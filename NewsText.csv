Doc_1,"Bigger Mortgages Likelier to Go Into Foreclosure; Since the recession, the foreclosure rates for more-expensive homes have consistently surpassed those for the overall market.","Bonislawski, Adam",None available.,"""Mo' money, mo' problems,"" proclaimed the late Brooklyn rapper Notorious B.I.G. He wasn't talking about the current U.S. foreclosure market, but he could have been. According to numbers from real estate analytics firm CoreLogic, in December 2014 the country's foreclosure rate fell to 1.4%, the lowest level since March 2008. But while the overall market is well on the way to recovery, elevated foreclosure rates persist at the high end. In December, the rate for mortgages of $750,000 or more was 2.5%. This disconnect has characterized the 2008 crash and its aftermath, says Sam Khater, CoreLogic's deputy chief economist. High-end housing had traditionally seen fewer foreclosures than the market at large, but, he notes, the last decade's recession turned that convention on its head. The CoreLogic data shows that in January 2006, the foreclosure rate for mortgages of $750,000 or more was 0.1%, compared with an overall rate of 0.5%. By March 2008, though, these numbers had crossed over, with the high-end rate up to 1.5%, versus 1.4% for the overall rate. Ultimately, the foreclosure rate for $750,000-plus mortgages topped out in May 2012 at 6.8%, almost double the peak of 3.6% that the overall market reached in October 2011. And while both rates declined for the last 21_ÅÊ2 years, the upper end of the market continues to see higher foreclosure levels. What accounts for this role reversal, which runs contrary to the broader U.S. trend of accelerating gains at the top of the income bracket? One key factor, Mr. Khater says, is that the 2008 housing crash was accompanied by a stock-market crash that disproportionately affected wealthier homeowners. Also contributing to the elevated rates at the high end, Mr. Khater notes, is the fact that several states with significant stocks of luxury housing have some of the highest foreclosure rates in the country. The three states with the highest December 2014 foreclosure rates are New Jersey (5.2%), New York (4.0%) and Florida (3.7%)--all spots with large concentrations of high-end homes. One reason recovery in these states has lagged behind, Mr. Khater says, is that they are judicial foreclosure states. In such states, foreclosures must be handled through the court system, which can lead to longer processing times. Credit: By Adam Bonislawski",,,,Wall Street Journal (Online),2015,5-Mar-15
Doc_2,"Puerto Rico Bankruptcy Bill Could Offer Roadmap for Creditors; Recent court decision left U.S. commonwealth's debt in a legal void, official says","Kuriloff, Aaron","Melba Acosta, president of the island's Government Development Bank, told the panel of the House Judiciary Committee that a bill permitting the island to let its so-called public corporations seek protection under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would help protect public services and plans for long-term growth.","A bill that would give Puerto Rico's government agencies access to the same bankruptcy protections provided to cities such as Detroit would provide a road map for investors if one or more runs out of money, a senior government official told a U.S. House committee Thursday. Melba Acosta, president of the island's Government Development Bank, told the panel of the House Judiciary Committee that a bill permitting the island to let its so-called public corporations seek protection under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would help protect public services and plans for long-term growth. Puerto Rico is currently barred from allowing its government entities to use Chapter 9. A recent decision by a federal judge to block a local law that would have provided a pathway for the power, water and highway agencies to restructure about $20 billion in debt leaves Puerto Rico in a legal void, creating an uncertain environment that threatens the island's economic future, she said. That lack of clarity reduces investor demand for Puerto Rico debt, affecting the government's strained cash flow, and undermines the administration's goal of making the agencies self-sufficient. Without a legal process in place, defaults could prompt ""a race to the courthouse,"" which could ""trigger years of litigation, exacerbate liquidity pressures at these public entities and have adverse consequences on economic growth, which only exacerbates Puerto Rico's overall fiscal situation,"" she said in written testimony. ""Creditors would be in a worse position than they would be under an orderly, consensual process."" The House bill would allow the agencies to follow the same path as Detroit, which emerged from a record municipal bankruptcy last year, and aims to reassure investors who are already familiar with the Chapter 9 process, according to Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico's nonvoting congressional representative, who sponsored it. Puerto Rico isn't asking for a bailout or special favors, he said. The U.S. commonwealth is struggling with a weak economy and a declining population. It has about $73 billion in debt, which is widely held by individuals and mutual funds nationwide because of its tax advantages. Moody's Investors Service said in a report last week that there is high probability of default on central government obligations within two years. Robert Donahue, managing director at Concord, Mass.-based research firm Municipal Market Analytics, called the bill a ""technical fix"" that may help avert chaotic defaults, receivership, years of lawsuits and even social unrest if agencies such as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority run out of cash to provide services. The utility, which has about $9 billion in municipal bonds and notes outstanding, is in talks with creditors, and Moody's expects a default some time this year. ""Among investors, many believe this is the lesser of two evils,"" Mr. Donahue, who also testified, said in an interview. ""This is not a bailout bill. It doesn't require any congressional resources. So for Congress it seems like a straightforward, simple way to keep Puerto Rico and the capital markets from negative consequences."" The bill's opponents include Thomas Mayer, partner and co-chairman of the corporate restructuring and bankruptcy group at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP, who told the committee that the use of Chapter 9 by Puerto Rico agencies would cause more harm than good. Mayer represents funds managed by Franklin Templeton Investments and OppenheimerFunds Inc., which hold about $1.6 billion in bonds from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and sued in federal court to block the island's local restructuring law. Mr. Mayer said Chapter 9 harms bondholders, takes years, costs millions and has no established body of case law. Puerto Rico isn't a state, and its law already provides for a receivership if an agency can't pay its debts. And the power authority, known as Prepa, doesn't need the law--it could raise rates, which have declined with fuel prices, he said. ""Chapter 9 itself does not offer 'certainty,'"" he said in prepared remarks. ""Chapter 9 is the Wild West."" University of Michigan law professor John Pottow, however, said the bill was an overdue correction to the bankruptcy code. It faces little opposition in the academic community where it's not even clear why Puerto Rico was excluded from Chapter 9 in the first place, he said. Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R. Va.) said in a statement that Chapter 9 could ""provide predictability, transparency and stability"" to a Puerto Rico agency bankruptcy, which would rank among the largest in U.S. history. He also cautioned that proposals to retroactively impact bondholders' rights deserve cautious analysis. Some investors remained skeptical about the bill's chances this week. Even if it advances beyond the committee, ""it is highly unlikely to be passed by either chamber of Congress, certainly the Senate,"" according to a report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Doc_3,Chinese Real-Estate Firm Looks West--to California; China Oceanwide Holdings Becoming One of Golden State's Most-Aggressive Property Buyers,"Brown, Eliot","Mr. Lu has amassed an unusually large amount of private residential property in the tony Silicon Valley town of Atherton. Since 2012, Mr. Lu has purchased three giant mansions in Atherton, paying $21 million, $25 million and $30 million, respectively, for 70 Barry Lane, 250 Atherton Ave. and 236 Park Lane, according to several people familiar with the sales.","A Chinese real-estate firm known for its big investments at home is casting its net much farther afield, becoming one of the most aggressive property buyers in California. China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co. and its chairman, Lu Zhiqiang, have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into U.S. West Coast commercial and residential real estate in the past two years, far from the company's traditional turf of projects in cities such as Beijing and Wuhan. The buying spree shows how, amid a wave of foreign money coming into U.S. commercial real estate, Chinese investors often top the list. After buying a site in 2013, Beijing-based Oceanwide is embarking on one of the largest developments currently under way in downtown Los Angeles: a three-tower complex of apartments, retail space and a hotel. In December, it announced it intended to build the second-tallest tower in San Francisco, a gleaming Norman Foster-designed 910-foot office building. It also paid $41 million for a ranch in Sonoma County that can hold a winery. Perhaps the most intriguing move: Mr. Lu has amassed an unusually large amount of private residential property in the tony Silicon Valley town of Atherton. Since 2012, Mr. Lu has purchased three giant mansions in Atherton, paying $21 million, $25 million and $30 million, respectively, for 70 Barry Lane, 250 Atherton Ave. and 236 Park Lane, according to several people familiar with the sales. Collectively, the three properties have 19 bedrooms and 22 bathrooms, according to property-sales listings. Then last spring, Mr. Lu tried to buy an even pricier home, offering $41 million to buy the former home of Jim Clark, co-founder of Netscape, according to court records and a person familiar with the matter. The deal, however, fell apart and the house was sold to another buyer. Oceanwide's dive into the U.S. is part of a diversification strategy, it has said of past acquisitions. In addition to property in China, the company invests in the financial industry, with holdings in banks, brokerages, trusts, and insurers. It also has investments in energy, advertising and print media in China. U.S. property has become increasingly attractive to fast-growing Chinese firms, which face a slowing Chinese housing market and see room for growth in the U.S. Chinese investors bought a record $3.9 billion of U.S. commercial real estate in 2014, nearly 1% of all commercial-property sales and the most of any foreign country other than Canada and Norway, according to Real Capital Analytics LLC. For Chinese companies, ""there definitely is a strong interest to invest overseas,"" said Darlene Chiu Bryant, executive director ChinaSF, an organization set up by the San Francisco mayor's office that aims to promote Chinese investment. Mrs. Chiu Bryant said that early last year, she introduced Oceanwide to Northwood Investors LLC and TMG Partners, developers that were drawing up plans for two towers on a site south of the city's downtown. Ultimately, Oceanwide agreed to buy the site for $296 million, more than twice what Northwood and TMG paid in 2013. Similarly aggressive prices are being paid by Chinese investors in Atherton, a leafy town near Stanford University where the 1950s-style ranch homes on winding streets have gradually been transformed into endless rows of mansions that have attracted Chinese investors. Brokers say foreign buyers, mostly from China, represent more than 75% of the market for houses listed at more than $20 million. A decade ago, the vast majority of buyers were local. ""Around 2011, that's when the floodgates really opened up,"" said Ken DeLeon, founder of DeLeon Realty, which specializes in high-end homes in Silicon Valley. Mr. DeLeon said developers have begun bringing in feng shui consultants, and prices of homes are listed with more eights at the end, a lucky number in Chinese culture. Some of the homes end up sitting vacant for much of the year, brokers say, used only when the owner visits the area. This, in turn, has sparked concerns among some longtime residents that an influx of foreign ownership could ultimately lead some neighborhoods to become empty during days and nights, where homes are just investments. Peter Carpenter, a board member of the Menlo Park Fire Protection District, which includes Atherton, said he worries about firefighters, who typically take risks to extinguish a fire under the presumption that a house is occupied. ""If you knew for sure that there was nobody in it, you would take a very different approach,"" he said. ""From a fire-department standpoint, it means putting your people at risk for no reason.""

Doc_4,"To Find Love Match, Try Love Math (Results Will Vary); How Lonely Nerds Tailored an Interstellar Formula to Quantify the Astronomical Odds of Finding a Mate",Jo Craven McGinty,"The seeker can include any number of criteria--say, the percentage of the population that is college-educated, the number who love ""The Hobbit,"" the fraction who spent their summers at science camp, or the portion who are blond, Republican, Catholic, taller than average or passionate about KenKen math puzzles. National Public Radio correspondent David Kestenbaum confided to Ira Glass in a segment of This American Life that he and his Harvard classmates, who were doctoral students in physics at the time, had worked out the equation, too. [...]sitcom writer Dave Goetsch introduced the concept in an episode of ""The Big Bang Theory"" in which a cast of fictional nerds--also a group of physicists and engineers--applied the equation to determine their odds of hooking up with someone on ""anything can happen Thursday.","A few years ago, a lonely American in London began to ponder his chances of finding a girlfriend. Surely in a city of 8 million people, plenty of women would find a dark-haired doctoral candidate in economics attractive. But how many women might be into him? What were his actual odds of finding love? These are questions more than a few lonely hearts are pondering this Valentine's Day. To try and answer as precisely as possible, Peter Backus, who was 31 at the time, used a mathematical equation to identify the number of women who fit his criteria for romance. The result, he calculated, was a depressing 26. Mr. Backus based his calculation on the Drake Equation, a probability formula devised in 1961 by astronomer and physicist Frank Drake to try to solve another great universal mystery: the number of planets in our galaxy that could sustain intelligent life . In Mr. Backus's romantic version of the Drake Equation, ""intelligent alien"" equaled ""girlfriend."" Here's how the equation works: In a given population--say, London or New York or wherever you happen to live--you apply a series of increasingly restrictive criteria until you end up with a subpopulation that satisfies all the conditions. The seeker can include any number of criteria--say, the percentage of the population that is college-educated, the number who love ""The Hobbit,"" the fraction who spent their summers at science camp, or the portion who are blond, Republican, Catholic, taller than average or passionate about KenKen math puzzles. Of course, statistics aren't available for every characteristic, and increasing the number of conditions--being choosier, if you will--quickly shrinks the pool of prospective mates. In Mr. Backus's case, he wanted to find a single woman around his age in London who was college-educated, attractive and--potential deal-breaker--one with whom he could get along. The product of the variables produced his result: U.K. population (60,975,000 at the time) x living in London (13%) x women (51%) x single (50%) x between the ages of 24 and 34 (20%) x university educated (26%) x he found attractive (5%) x found him attractive (5%) x compatible (10%). He obtained most of the figures from the U.K. Office for National Statistics. The three dealing with attractiveness and compatibility were estimates based on his personal experience. ""My friends thought that's a very Peter thing to do,"" Mr. Backus, who is now married and still living in the U.K., said of his calculation, which he wrote up as a joke and posted online . But he wasn't alone in his analytical quest for love. Around the same time he deduced his odds for finding a mate, a doctoral student in astrobiology in Seattle wondered how many suitable partners were out there for him. Among his criteria: Must love the Denver Broncos. Yet another doctoral candidate, studying electrical and computer engineering in Ontario, had the same idea , writing up his assessment in an essay called ""Single LGM Seeks Same."" LGM stands for ""little green man."" Clearly, a tolerance for Martian jokes was a plus. Those three were preceded a decade earlier by a computer-science graduate from Saskatchewan who weighed his chances and, arriving at his mathematical answer, opined that he would never have a girlfriend . Among his criteria: one standard deviation above the norm for intelligence, and two standard deviations above the norm for beauty. These lonely young men aren't the only ones to have jotted down the Drake Equation to estimate their chances of finding love. National Public Radio correspondent David Kestenbaum confided to Ira Glass in a segment of This American Life that he and his Harvard classmates, who were doctoral students in physics at the time, had worked out the equation, too. And sitcom writer Dave Goetsch introduced the concept in an episode of ""The Big Bang Theory"" in which a cast of fictional nerds--also a group of physicists and engineers--applied the equation to determine their odds of hooking up with someone on ""anything can happen Thursday."" ""I thought this is exactly how our characters think,"" Mr. Goetsch said. It might be tempting to joke that it is obvious why none of these young men had a romantic partner. In each case--real-life and fictional--each turned not to courtship to solve his problem but to analytics, perhaps with the goal of demonstrating that not having a mate wasn't his fault. After all, according to their calculations, the odds were against them. But not so fast! Mr. Backus found and married someone who matched his parameters, and most of the others have also found mates. It seems they have defied the odds--perhaps because at some point they set aside their calculations and concluded love cannot be reduced to a number. As Raymond Francis, the Ontario student who now, as a postdoctoral scholar, helps support NASA's Mars Science Laboratory, said: ""You could spend lot of time trying to nail down those factors. But maybe you should just start looking for someone."" Write to Jo Craven McGinty at Jo.McGinty@wsj.com Credit: By Jo Craven McGinty",College football,,,Wall Street Journal (Online),2015,13-Feb-15

Since receiving a $25 million investment from Iconix Brand Group in late 2013, the company has focused intensively on video, creating 13 original series and a news channel as well as striking ad deals with McDonald's Corp., Nissan Motor Co., PepsiCo Inc.'s Mountain Dew and Adidas AG, among others.","A Hollywood heavyweight is joining the online media battle for better video advertising. Complex Media, which owns a network of websites focused on street fashion, music and pop culture, is bringing in film director Spike Lee to advise on video projects and the kind of ""branded content"" advertising campaigns that have become a key driver of digital media growth. Such video campaigns are usually produced by a Web publisher to resemble editorial content. ""I am hyped about this collaboration,"" said the 57-year-old Mr. Lee, whose films include ""Do the Right Thing"" and ""Malcolm X."" ""There are no specific rules. We can do what we want to do."" The move comes amid a broad push among online media players to invest heavily in video units that draw substantially more revenue per ad than other forms of online advertising. Vox Media Inc. says as much as 40% of its revenue in 2015 is expected to come from its fast-growing video operation, and the Huffington Post says it is aiming to attach a video component to 50% of its roughly 1,200 average daily posts by year-end. Traditional media groups, including The Wall Street Journal, are also moving to expand video operations. Complex is a relative veteran in the online media space, having started as a men's fashion magazine in 2002 and eventually growing into an array of more than 100 websites focusing on hip-hop, sneaker and skateboarding culture.

""Once we doubled down on video production, we saw tremendous growth, both from our viewing audience [and from] increased desire from brands for video activations from us,"" said Marc Ecko, the fashion designer who founded the company and returned to a day-to-day role as chief brand officer in December, referring to videos that are made at the behest of advertisers. Overall, Complex has recorded a 45% jump in traffic to its sites in the past year, to 44.4 million unique visitors in January, according to analytics firm comScore Inc. The closely held company's flagship site, Complex.com, has had a 74% rise in traffic in the same period, with 12.6 million unique visitors in January. The company said it doubled its video budget in 2014 and saw total revenue grow by 35% that year. Complex's partnership with Mr. Lee relies on his experience in the advertising industry. In the late 1980s, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker produced a string of notable commercials for Nike featuring himself as the character Mars Blackmon alongside basketball legend Michael Jordan. In 1997, Mr. Lee founded his own boutique ad agency, Spike DDB, as part of Omnicom Group Inc.'s DDB Worldwide. While Complex hopes Mr. Lee's marquee value will give them a leg up on other sites, it faces stiff competition in an increasingly crowded field. Complex also has opted to produce fewer, more expensive long-form documentary-style videos instead of the high volume of short-form, news-oriented or entertainment clips other sites have gravitated toward. Mr. Ecko said quality rather than quantity should set the site apart. ""There is definitely a frothiness, a shininess in the space,"" he said. ""But I think when you really look at what we have been doing--we have been honing and refining and iterating and we are finally growing--I think it will be very evident how we are different.""

Doc_7,"Bitcoin's Plunge Bites 'Miners'; As Value Falls, Some Pull Plug on Computers Supporting System","Casey, Michael J","The mathematical formula that regulates the supply of the digital currency is designed to adjust for such shifts by changing the difficulty of a mathematical puzzle that miners must solve to earn new bitcoins, thus crimping the amount of bitcoins in circulation.","A rapid collapse in the value of bitcoin is squeezing some owners of the computers that support the digital currency and raising concerns about its viability. Bitcoin's value fell 21% to $179.37 late Wednesday, according to news service Coindesk. The virtual currency, which trades mostly in unregulated overseas markets, has fallen 44% since the start of the year and 85% from the record high of $1,165 it hit in early December 2013. In total, almost $11.3 billion in value has been lost since that peak. ""The people who most believed in the long-term value of bitcoin holdings are the people who got hurt the most,"" said Chase Sechrist, a 22-year software developer based in Austin, Texas, who sunk $30,000, or ""most of his savings,"" into the digital currency, starting ""at the top of the summer 2014 hype cycle."" Having lost virtually all of it, Mr. Sechrist says he'll ""be out of bitcoin for quite a while,"" at least until it is better regulated, though he still strongly believes in the future benefits of its core payments technology. The price decline is causing turmoil for bitcoin ""miners""--the independent computer owners who confirm and process transactions in the currency. Miners are compensated with freshly issued bitcoins, which in turn are added to the total supply. As the price of bitcoin falls against the dollar and other traditional currencies, the miners' profits get squeezed. The financial challenge has been made more acute by increasingly tough competition to earn bitcoin, the result of a 30-fold increase in the computer firepower being deployed by the miners, according to the bitcoin-monitoring company Blockchain. That expansion in technology has given the network 13,000 times more computing power than that of the world's 500 largest supercomputers combined, according to Bitcoinwatch.com and Top500.org. To keep up, many miners kept building capacity and adding faster machines, even though the falling price ate into their profitability. Only now, with the new year bringing steeper price declines, have capitulations begun. On Monday, London-based CEX.io announced it would temporarily halt a ""cloud mining"" operation by which it mines bitcoins on behalf of clients who rent out its bitcoin processing power. In a blog post, it blamed ""the recent bitcoin price drop, as well as the upscaling of the mining difficulty."" And on Tuesday, CoinTerra Inc. said it had been forced to default on a bond payment after being shut out of a Utah data center in which it had run a bitcoin-mining operation that once accounted for around 3% of the total bitcoin network. The facility owner, C7 Data Centers Inc., has sued it for nonpayment of fees. Such departures have for the first time resulted in declines in the ""hash rate,"" a metric that measures the total computational power of the mining network. That has led some bitcoin enthusiasts to express anxiety in online trading chat rooms that an acceleration of miner exits might leave the network with insufficient computing and cause problems for the wider bitcoin economy. The mathematical formula that regulates the supply of the digital currency is designed to adjust for such shifts by changing the difficulty of a mathematical puzzle that miners must solve to earn new bitcoins, thus crimping the amount of bitcoins in circulation. But because those adjustments have lag time, some speculated that a sharp drop in the hash rate would leave a depleted mining network working overtime. Bitcoin software developers say such concerns are overblown. The hash rate would have to fall suddenly by around 90% to cause problems, they said, whereas the peak-to-trough decline in the average hash rate has only been around 10% since December. ""It takes huge hash rate changes to noticeably change the block time,"" said Gregory Maxwell, one of five coders charged with maintaining bitcoin's open-source operational program. Nonetheless, talk of a mining crisis, which followed a hacking attack last week at Slovenia-based bitcoin exchange Bitstamp, stirred many to sell, says Greg Schvey, a partner at bitcoin market analytics firm TradeBlock. Selling was also amplified in Asian trading hours, where margin calls were triggered on exchanges such as Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, which allow leverage-based trading. Once the price fell below levels at which those traders were required to post more collateral, automated waves of selling ensued. Traders said market patterns suggested that computerized trading machines, or bots, had placed big sell orders deliberately designed to trigger those margin calls. The good news for mining, however, is that the market ""is getting to the point where it finds an economic equilibrium,"" said Mr. Schvey, noting that departing mining operators are boosting market share and profits for those who remain.

Shopify Inc. is working on a plan to raise roughly $100 million in a dual U.S.-Canada IPO that could value the company at well over $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Banks including Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG and RBC Capital Markets have recently been tapped to work with the Ottawa-based company on the deal, the people said. The IPO could launch as early as the spring, but the timing will depend on market conditions, one of the people said. The tech startup has grown sharply since its inception in 2006, providing software and services that enable small and midsize merchants, as well as bigger firms such as Tesla Motors Inc., to sell goods online. It also works with brick-and-mortar and pop-up retailers, which use its software on tablets to make sales and track inventory. It competes with giants such as Amazon.com Inc. and eBay Inc., as well as other startups such as Square Inc. Some people familiar with the company's thinking said that it could still consider acquisition offers from bigger players in e-commerce, but an IPO is the more likely path. Shopify hasn't disclosed revenue figures, but the company's website says more than 120,000 merchants use its platform, up from more than 80,000 at the end of 2013. More than $5 billion worth of gross merchandise has been sold on Shopify's platforms since 2006, according to the company's website. In December 2013, , The Wall Street Journal reported at the time. Its backers include Bessemer Venture Partners, Felicis Ventures, FirstMark Capital, Georgian Partners, Insight Venture Partners and OMERS Ventures. The company has raised $122 million in total, according to its website. Shopify could be among the most valuable tech startups in Canada to go public. Social media analytics platform Hootsuite Media Inc., which raised money last year at a roughly $800 million valuation, is considering an IPO, the Journal has reported. Health-care software firm PointClickCare Corp. also has been working on a potential IPO, which could value it at around $1 billion, the Journal reported in June 2014. E-commerce companies were a big driver of the IPO market in 2014, though performance of deals was mixed. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which operates an online marketplace that caters to small and midsize vendors in China, went public in the biggest deal ever, at $25 billion, and is up 52% since its offering in September. But Wayfair Inc., an online home-goods seller, is down 27% from its October IPO, and global e-commerce services provider Borderfree Inc. is down 46% from its March IPO.

Doc_9,Gross Helps Fuel New Fund With His Own Cash; Brokerage Tied to 'Bond King' Routed More Than $700 Million to Gross's New Fund in October and November,"Grind, Kirsten; Zuckerman, Gregory","Janus shares have pulled back since then but are still up 11% since he took over the fund in early October, and the firm saw more inflows in October across all of its mutual funds than it has in any single month since 2007, according to data tracker Morningstar Inc. ""Obviously, he's off to a great start raising a lot of attention and assets,"" Dick Weil, Janus's chief executive, recently said of Mr. Gross.","After Bill Gross abruptly quit Pacific Investment Management Co., the bond-fund giant he co-founded, in September to join a much smaller rival, the big question was how much money would follow him. His new firm, Janus Capital Group Inc., subsequently disclosed that investors poured about $1.1 billion into Mr. Gross's new fund in October and November. That money was critical, because it helped push the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond fund past $1 billion in assets under management, a key threshold for large investors, according to industry experts. Despite Mr. Gross's status as a star fund manager, some large pension funds and their consultants have said they couldn't consider a fund with less than $1 billion in assets. But what Janus didn't tell investors was that, in a previously unreported development, a majority of the money came from a single Southern California brokerage office--the same office where one of Mr. Gross's personal financial advisers works, according to industry executives who have viewed confidential brokerage data. The Morgan Stanley wealth-management office in La Jolla, Calif., routed more than $700 million to Mr. Gross's Janus fund in October and November, according to people who viewed brokerage-firm fund-asset data from Albridge, a data firm owned by Bank of New York Mellon Corp. The transfers accounted for more than 60% of the money raised by Mr. Gross in the first few months after he left Pimco. It isn't clear whether the money originated from one investor or one financial adviser, or from more than one, although Mr. Gross acknowledges at least some of the money came from him. While it isn't unusual for a manager to invest in his own fund, industry executives say it is extremely rare for one firm or office to account for such a large percentage of a prominent fund's incoming cash. A spokesman for Denver-based Janus said the firm doesn't comment on specific fund shareholders and their investments ""as a matter of policy and out of respect for the privacy of the firms we serve and their mutual fund investors."" The spokesman also wouldn't comment on how much of the fund is made up of Mr. Gross's money. A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A spokesman for Albridge said, ""Any data generated from Albridge Analytics' system is confidential and public use of the data is neither authorized nor permitted."" After questions from The Wall Street Journal, Janus Capital on Wednesday tweeted a comment attributed to Mr. Gross: Janus declined to comment further. Mr. Gross, 70 years old, is a billionaire who earned more than $200 million a year before he left Pimco, the giant money manager he helped start four decades ago and then abruptly left in September. His departure shocked the investment community and triggered a scrum for tens of billions of dollars, as rivals tried to poach Pimco's clients. Investors pulled $150 billion from Pimco last year, most of it in the months after Mr. Gross's departure. In the latest example, New York City's five pension funds withdrew nearly $5 billion from Pimco, a spokesman for New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said Wednesday. Investors in Janus shares have bet his arrival would help the beleaguered money manager--which has suffered from years of outflows due to poor performance--attract investors. Janus's stock jumped 43% on Sept. 26, 2014, the day Mr. Gross's hire was announced, the biggest one-day gain in the company's history. Janus shares have pulled back since then but are still up 11% since he took over the fund in early October, and the firm saw more inflows in October across all of its mutual funds than it has in any single month since 2007, according to data tracker Morningstar Inc. ""Obviously, he's off to a great start raising a lot of attention and assets,"" Dick Weil, Janus's chief executive, recently said of Mr. Gross. The La Jolla office of Morgan Stanley is in a small, affluent community just north of San Diego and about 80 miles south of Mr. Gross's Janus office in Newport Beach. The La Jolla office is where one of Mr. Gross's own financial advisers, Robert Inbody, works, according to people familiar with his role. Mr. Inbody referred all queries to Morgan Stanley. Mr. Gross doesn't live in La Jolla, but it isn't unusual for wealthy individuals to have multiple financial advisers in different locations, say brokers. Albridge provides data from the four largest financial firms selling mutual funds to investors: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, UBS AG, Wells Fargo & Co. and Morgan Stanley. The data, covering the majority of mutual-fund sales, is provided to clients who pay a fee to subscribe. In October, according to the Albridge data viewed by industry executives, more than $300 million of total investor inflows into Mr. Gross's Janus fund came from the Morgan Stanley office in La Jolla. According to Morningstar, the fund saw a total of about $360 million of inflows that month, meaning 87% of all new money that came into the fund in Mr. Gross's first full month on the job originated from that office. In November, the office contributed about $400 million out of $770 million in total inflows, according to the people who viewed the Albridge data and Morningstar. When Mr. Gross took over the fund at Janus in early October, it had just $12 million in assets under management following its launch in May 2014, according to Morningstar. The firm was expected to report new asset totals for December on Wednesday. The fund follows a different strategy than Mr. Gross adhered to while running the Total Return fund at Pimco, allowing him to invest in a variety of bonds and other securities. The fund has lost 1.1% since Mr. Gross took over Oct. 6 through Tuesday, ranking it in the 52nd percentile in its category, according to Morningstar. Janus rivals such as Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc. appear to have taken a much bigger share of the outflows from Pimco's mutual funds, which totaled about $150 billion in 2014, according to Morningstar's most recent data. Vanguard, for example, saw $10.3 billion flow into its Total Bond Market Index fund in October, the fund's highest monthly inflow on record. Mr. Gross got a boost in November when George Soros's Soros Fund Management made a $500 million investment, although that amount is run through a separate account at Janus that isn't part of Mr. Gross's mutual fund. Fund managers are required by a Securities and Exchange Commission regulation to report the amount, within a range, that they invest in mutual funds that they manage. Morningstar shows no investment from Mr. Gross in the fund, though it wasn't clear whether that was due to a potential lag in reporting schedules. Janus declined to comment on its regulatory reporting. When Mr. Gross ran Pimco's flagship Total Return fund, he regularly invested his own money, according to people familiar with the matter. Before he left Pimco, Mr. Gross held an investment of $1 million or more in the Total Return fund, according to Morningstar. Mr. Inbody of Morgan Stanley is one of the firm's biggest producers in Southern California, according to people familiar with the matter. His LinkedIn profile says he has been a managing director at the firm since 1971.

Doc_10,Digits: News Digest,Anonymous,None available.,"Alibaba Breathes New Life Into Ouya Ouya, the game-console maker that has struggled to gain traction since its record-breaking Kickstarter campaign, has received a new injection of capital from a powerful strategic partner. Alibaba invested $10 million in the Santa Monica, Calif., company last month, according to people familiar with the matter. The two companies have discussed a plan to incorporate Ouya's software and library of more than 1,000 games into Alibaba's set-top box, the people said. The investment could help Ouya find new life in China, a market where gaming is primed for growth. China's State Council recently lifted a ban on videogame consoles that had been in place since 2000, and dozens of new entrants are now flooding the country with low-priced set-top boxes that run cheap or free-to-play games. Ouya got its start on Kickstarter in 2012, becoming the fastest project to raise $1 million--in just over eight hours--as game enthusiasts were excited about the console's $99 price and its link with Google's Android operating system. The company ended up gathering $8.6 million, and in 2013 began selling the console in stores such as Target, Best Buy and on Amazon.com. But Ouya suffered from poor reviews and had a difficult time making inroads in a U.S. console market dominated by Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox. It has also competed with a growing number of cheap video-streaming devices such as Amazon's Fire TV, which hook into app stores loaded with games. That competitive pressure, along with the high costs of manufacturing a hardware device, have led Ouya to shift its focus away from hardware and look for opportunities to license its library of games to other devices and to manufacturers outside the U.S. Enter Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant which has gained a foothold in the U.S. market over the past year by grabbing chunks of Silicon Valley startups. It invested $215 million in mobile-messaging startup Tango last year, following investments in app search-engine Quixey and two-day shipping provider ShopRunner. But the Internet giant also appears to be interested in striking strategic deals with U.S. startups to import technology and entertainment to China. Last year, Alibaba bought a roughly 10% stake in U.S. mobile-game company Kabam for $120 million to distribute its games through Alibaba mobile apps in China. In investing in Ouya, Alibaba executives expressed interest in bringing the startup's marketplace of games into its set-top boxes, though no such agreement has been reached as yet, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Alibaba makes its own set-top boxes, including the recently-released Tmall Box 2, and licenses an operating system for devices made by other companies. These devices already offer a selection of games made by third-party developers. Partnering with Ouya to expand its library of games could help Alibaba get its devices into more Chinese homes, where it can sell digital content and get more visitors to its online store. Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp.000063.SZ -1.83% released Ouya-like Android game consoles last year. Ouya also struck a deal last year to provide games to TV-streaming devices made by fast-growing Chinese tech startup Xiaomi. As a result of that deal, Ouya is working with its developers to translate their titles and help make them appeal to Chinese users. Ouya will continue to share a portion of sales from those games with developers, but it will also share a smaller portion with Xiaomi. Before the Alibaba investment, Ouya had raised $15 million from investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Mayfield Fund, Shasta Ventures and chipmaker Nvidia, in addition to the money it raised on Kickstarter. Douglas MacMillan Microsoft Invests In Rogue Android Startup Microsoft is investing in a hot startup that's trying to weaken Google's hold over Android. People familiar with the matter say Microsoft is putting money into Cyanogen, which is building a version of the Android mobile-operating system outside of Google's auspices. Microsoft would be a minority investor in a roughly $70 million round of equity financing that values Cyanogen in the high hundreds of millions, one of the people said. The person said the financing round could grow with other strategic investors that have expressed interest in Cyanogen because they're also eager to diminish Google's control over Android. The identity of the other potential investors couldn't be learned. Spokespeople for Microsoft and Cyanogen declined to comment. The investment would be unusual, because Microsoft offers its own Windows Phone mobile operating system. But Windows Phone has only about 3% market share, which may be prompting Microsoft to consider unconventional steps. Android was intended as an ""open source"" operating system that hardware makers can deploy in their devices for free. Yet Google has frustrated manufacturers in recent years by requiring them to feature Google apps and set Google search as the default for users, in exchange for access to the search engine, YouTube, or the millions of apps in its Play Store. Such restrictions make it harder for apps that compete with Google's to win distribution on Android devices. For Microsoft, that means less exposure for its Bing search engine, which is up against Google search. It also could limit growth of other Microsoft software products. Cyanogen offers an alternate version of the Android mobile operating system free of such restrictions. The 80-person company claims to have a volunteer army of 9,000 software developers working on its own version of Android. ""We're going to take Android away from Google,"" said Kirt McMaster, Cyanogen's chief executive, in a brief interview last week. The next day, at an industry event sponsored by tech news service The Information, Mr. McMaster said Cyanogen had raised $100 million to date. Previously the company had disclosed that it raised $30 million of funding. The company spokeswoman declined to make McMaster available for this story. Mr. McMaster said more than 50 million people use a version of the Cyanogen Android operating system, most of whom have installed it in place of their phone's initial operating system. To spread adoption more quickly, Cyanogen is working on deals with hardware makers to install the software on their devices. It recently signed a deal with Indian smartphone maker Micromax to ship handsets with Cyanogen's software and is close to announcing more such deals, say people familiar with the matter. A third mobile ecosystem as an alternative to rivals Google and Apple could help Microsoft better distribute its apps and services on smartphones. ""Cyanogen may have a greater chance than Microsoft to build a third ecosystem for mobile,"" says Rajeev Chand, managing director at Rutberg & Co., an investment bank focused on the mobile industry. Independent versions of the Android operating system are already popular, particularly in China where Google has struggled to enter the market. In total, these other versions represented 37% of Android shipments world-wide in the third quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. Smartphone makers and wireless carriers are looking for a standard bearer to offset Google's growing market power, Chand says. Prior investors in Cyanogen included Benchmark Capital, Redpoint Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Chinese social-networking giant Tencent. New venture capital investors are expected to join the strategic corporate investors in this latest round of funding. Rolfe Winkler and Shira Ovide",,,,Wall Street Journal (Online),2015,30-Jan-15

The youth-oriented chain, known for its T-shirts, leggings and sex-themed advertising, has been looking for a way forward after ousting founder and Chief Executive Dov Charney late last year. American Apparel also has been struggling with falling sales and swelling losses . Ms. Erland's most recent experience includes serving as a senior marketing executive at Perry Ellis International.

Both will report to American Apparel's new CEO, Paula Schneider, who succeeded Mr. Charney. The Wall Street Journal late last year reported that American Apparel has been pressed by hedge fund Lion Capital to consider options, including a possible sale of the company. Lion Capital's request followed a preliminary takeover proposal from private-equity firm Irving Place Capital that valued the retailer at $1.30 to $1.40 a share, or as much as $245 million.

Doc_12,Ruling Throws Puerto Rico's Effort to Remake Finances Into Doubt; Judge Blocks Law That Would Have Allowed Some Public Agencies to Restructure Debt,"Kuriloff, Aaron","Robert Donahue, managing director at Concord, Mass.-based research firm Municipal Market Analytics, said the decision removes the only orderly framework for Puerto Rico debt restructuring even as the government's liquidity problems worsen, and may undermine the administration's effort to ""ring fence"" the island's general obligation debt and sales tax debt from that of its struggling agencies.","An effort by Puerto Rico to remake its finances was thrown into uncertainty after a federal judge in San Juan blocked a law that would have allowed some public agencies to restructure their debts. In a decision Friday prohibiting the U.S. commonwealth from enforcing the so-called Recovery Act, Judge Francisco A. Besosa said the law, passed in June 2014, is pre-empted by federal bankruptcy code and is therefore void under the U.S. Constitution's supremacy clause. Creditors holding almost $2 billion in debt from the island's cash-strapped power utility had asked the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico to block the law, arguing that only Congress is allowed to create bankruptcy rules. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or Prepa, appointed a chief restructuring officer in September. Robert Donahue, managing director at Concord, Mass.-based research firm Municipal Market Analytics, said the decision removes the only orderly framework for Puerto Rico debt restructuring even as the government's liquidity problems worsen, and may undermine the administration's effort to ""ring fence"" the island's general obligation debt and sales tax debt from that of its struggling agencies. ""It means they go back to square one,"" he said. Prepa, which owes about $10 billion, is at the forefront of Puerto Rico's long running financial difficulties as it works to find cash for operations and to pay lenders. Overhauling the island's so-called public corporations has been a priority for the administration of Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla as it tries to boost the economy, eliminate budget deficits and convince investors that the island's financial health is improving. Lawmakers in Puerto Rico last June passed legislation allowing some public agencies, including the island's power, water and highway authorities, to restructure their debts. The law doesn't apply to the island's general obligation or sales tax debt. Puerto Rico has about $73 billion in debt, including that owed by its public corporations, and it has been struggling with high unemployment and a sluggish economy. Its bonds are widely held by mutual funds and individuals because of their tax advantages, and some investors fear the island's problems could cause bondholder losses nationwide. Matthew McGill, an attorney for BlueMountain Capital Management LLC, which sued along with mutual funds managed by Franklin Templeton Investments and OppenheimerFunds Inc., called the judge's decision gratifying in a statement. ""We look forward to working with Prepa's stakeholders to develop a sustainable path forward,"" he said. A spokesman for the island's Government Development Bank said officials were reviewing the ruling and would decide later on a course of action.

Doc_13,Apple Says App Store Sales Rose 50% in 2014; Maker of iPhone and iPad Says Sales at Its App Store Totaled About $15 Billion,"Wakabayashi, Daisuke","Analysts estimate that Apple's revenue grew 10% in 2014, according to CapitalIQ. [...]the vast majority of App Store revenue flows directly to the bottom line--making it an increasingly meaningful contributor to Apple's profit.","Apple Inc. has a largely straightforward business model: It makes hardware, sells it at a premium and pockets the difference. The rapid growth of its App Store is starting to change the formula. Apple said total billings from paid apps and purchases made within apps for its mobile devices rose 50% last year, from more than $10 billion in 2013. That implies App Store sales of roughly $15 billion, making Apple's take around $4.5 billion. Apple keeps 30 cents of every dollar that flows through the App Store. That is still a relatively small slice of Apple's $183 billion in annual sales. But it is growing much faster: Analysts estimate that Apple's revenue grew 10% in 2014, according to CapitalIQ. Moreover, the vast majority of App Store revenue flows directly to the bottom line--making it an increasingly meaningful contributor to Apple's profit. Apple's net income for the year ended in September 2014 totaled $39.5 billion. Apple released the App Store figures--saying it paid App Store developers more than $10 billion in 2014--as part of a new campaign to highlight its contribution to the U.S. economy. Apple has been criticized in the past for relying on hundreds of thousands of workers in China to build its main products, such as the iPhone. The company has started producing some lower-volume products, such as the Mac Pro computer, in the U.S. Apple said it has created--directly and indirectly--more than one million U.S. jobs. Roughly two-thirds, by Apple's count, are developers creating programs to run on the iPhone, iPad and iPod. The company opened the App Store in 2008, a year after it introduced the first iPhone. The store created a marketplace that paved the way for a new era of mobile software development and gave Apple a head start in luring app developers to its software platform. That dynamic started to shift in recent years with the surging popularity of Google Inc.'s competing Android operating system. Roughly 84% of smartphones shipped in the third quarter of 2014 run on Android, compared with 12% for Apple's iOS, according to research firm IDC. Despite Android's greater market share, iOS users spend more money on apps. Analytics firm App Annie said Android users downloaded 60% more apps in the third quarter than Apple users, but App Store revenue was 60% greater than that of Google's competing Play store. In June 2014, Google said it had paid more than $5 billion to developers over the prior 13 months, excluding Google's 30% cut. That implies total app sales of roughly $7 billion. On average, Android phones are cheaper than iPhones, and Android users spend less on apps. Apple also has a longer history of selling digital goods--dating to the launch of the iTunes store in 2003--and more credit-card numbers on file, greasing the wheels of mobile commerce. Apple said 300,000 of the U.S. jobs it has helped to create are at parts and materials suppliers, or construction workers at Apple facilities. Apple said it directly employs 66,000 workers in the U.S., including 30,000 people at its retail stores. Rolfe Winkler contributed to this article.

Doc_14,Meet the Corporate Board's 'Kitchen Junk Drawer'; Workload of the Audit Committee Has Expanded Well Beyond Oversight of Financial Reporting,"Rapoport, Michael; Lublin, Joann S","The retired CFO of Constellation Energy Group already was Ryder System Inc.'s lead director, as well as an audit panel member there and at Kraft Foods Group Inc. Ms. Smith told Discover Financial directors that she had more board work than she wanted, recalls one person with knowledge of the matter. ""From the perspective of the board, the audit committee looks like the entity that has the most expertise on anything related to risk,"" says Daniel Goelzer, a Baker & McKenzie lawyer and former interim chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the government's audit regulator.","As new risks multiply, the audit committee has become the ""kitchen junk drawer"" for many corporate boards. The workload of the powerful committees has expanded sharply beyond their core role of overseeing a company's financial reporting. They are grappling with new regulations, whistleblower claims and issues like cybersecurity and foreign corruption. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to suggest new rules by the end of next month requiring them to disclose more about their activities. ""It's not the favorite committee,'' says Fredric Reynolds, a retired CBS Corp. chief financial officer and audit committee chairman at Mondelez International Inc. To attract committee members, he sometimes promises relatively short stints: ""You'll be released for time served and good behavior,'' he tells directors. Mr. Reynolds estimates he spends 100-plus hours a year on Mondelez's audit committee. One key part of that is the audit committees' oversight of whistleblower complaints, which is required by the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The vast majority are from people frustrated with their work colleagues, he adds. But when there's smoke, ""you don't know if it's fire."" The speed and complexity of business and risk oversight ""are stretching and straining many audit committee agendas,"" according to a global survey of audit committee members released last week by accounting firm KPMG. Three-quarters of the 1,500 respondents said the amount of time required to carry out their responsibilities has increased at least ""moderately"" over the past two years. Serving on an audit committee ""has taken more time than I expected,'' says a former tech-industry finance chief who sits on the board of a fast-growing community bank. In August, he became interim chief executive of a closely held aerospace company, and says he warned the bank he didn't have enough time for both roles. But, he says, the bank's chairman told him, ""We want you to stay involved in the audit committee."" He concedes that he has since skipped two board meetings. Some boards appear to view the audit committee as a place to hand off any internal oversight issues, even if they are outside the committee's traditional purview. ""Sometimes the audit committee is viewed as the kitchen junk drawer,'' says Cindy Fornelli, executive director of the Center for Audit Quality, an accounting-industry group. Boards feel ""if we don't know what to do with it, we'll give it to the audit committee."" Some directors remain unfazed by the heavy workload because they enjoy being where the action is. ""It's where you have a very broad access to management time and information about the business,"" says James Quigley, audit committee chairman for Wells Fargo & Co. For some, however, the increased demands are taking a toll. E. Follin Smith resigned as audit committee chairman and a director of Discover Financial Services last spring because of the intense demands, according to people familiar with the situation. The retired CFO of Constellation Energy Group already was Ryder System Inc.'s lead director, as well as an audit panel member there and at Kraft Foods Group Inc. Ms. Smith told Discover Financial directors that she had more board work than she wanted, recalls one person with knowledge of the matter. ""She had a lot on her plate.'' Ms. Smith didn't respond to phone calls seeking comment. Government investigations can boost an audit committee's work. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s audit committee held an additional 13 meetings during fiscal 2014, because of probes into allegations that the big retailer had bribed officials in Mexico and other countries, according to its proxy. Wal-Mart has said it is cooperating with U.S. and Mexican government investigations in the matter. Christopher Williams, head of Wal-Mart's audit committee, couldn't be reached. Sarbanes-Oxley contributed to the more expansive view of the audit committee's role. In addition to requiring such committees to establish procedures to handle whistleblower complaints, the law made it clear the audit committee hires the outside auditor, and that it must be made up entirely of independent directors. ""From the perspective of the board, the audit committee looks like the entity that has the most expertise on anything related to risk,"" says Daniel Goelzer, a Baker & McKenzie lawyer and former interim chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the government's audit regulator. The SEC plans to issue a ""concept release"" by the end of March on what audit committees should tell investors--a step toward revamping disclosure requirements for the first time since 1999. Accounting and corporate-governance groups have urged audit committees to voluntarily disclose more to shareholders, but the SEC thinks the voluntary disclosures lack uniformity. Only 13% of companies in the S&P 500 disclosed to investors their audit commitees' specific considerations in approving their auditor, such as qualifications and geographic reach, according to a recent analysis by the Center for Audit Quality and consulting firm Audit Analytics. As audit committees face the possibility of more work, even the most dedicated director has limits. Mr. Reynolds, the Mondelez audit committee chairman, also serves on Hess Corp.'s audit committee. He was chairman of AOL Inc.'s audit panel until stepping down in 2013 because he also was lead independent director. ""It was a little too much,"" Mr. Reynolds recalls.

The National Association of Software and Services Companies, or Nasscom, said software exports would rise as much as 14% to $112 billion in the year starting April, more than the 12% growth projected this year. Increased use of new technology platforms such as cloud, analytics and big data are helping boost demand, it said. An improving U.S. economy is also helping Indian outsourcing firms win new orders, although demand from Europe softened in the second half of the fiscal year weighed by unfavorable currency movements and weakness in some European economies, Nasscom said. ""The current fiscal year brought in overall optimism for the industry. The future looks very promising,"" it said in a statement. Brighter prospects for India's software exports would help support a recovery in the south Asian economy that is gradually pulling out of a prolonged slowdown. Software and technology services are the second-largest foreign revenue earner for India and accounted for 8% of the country's gross domestic product last fiscal year.

The bank's disappointing results strike a sour note ahead of earnings reports in coming days from China's biggest state-owned banks, which are grappling slowing economic growth, a rise in bad loans and regulatory pressure on their profitability. The state lender said Tuesday that its 2014 net profit rose 8% to 179.46 billion yuan ($28.9 billion) from 166.32 billion yuan in 2013. The profit for 2014 was weaker than the median 183.76 billion yuan forecast from 27 analysts polled by Thomson One Analytics. The bank didn't break out its results for the fourth quarter, but analysts said the full-year figure suggests a drop in profit for the period. The bank's final-quarter profit fell an estimated 4% from a year earlier, said Bernstein bank analyst Wei Hou. ""AgBank recorded a rapid buildup of bad loans in the fourth quarter as the Chinese economy started to face more headwinds in the second half of 2014,"" said Mr. Hou. The bank said its nonperforming loans climbed 42% to 124.97 billion yuan at the end of 2014 compared with a year ago. Its bad loan ratio was 1.54% at the end of last year, up from 1.22% a year earlier. Song Xianping, the executive responsible for risk control at Agbank, told a news briefing on Tuesday that last year the lender sold more than 26 billion yuan worth of nonperforming loans to China's asset management companies, which were set up by the government in the 1990s to buy up bad debt from the nation's state banks. Mr. Song said that the bad loans were sold at 37% of their face value, which he said was relatively higher than the loans sold by other major state banks. Meanwhile, the bank's provisions set aside for possible losses declined to 286.5% of its nonperforming loans at the end of last year, down from 367% a year earlier. That was still well above the regulatory requirement of 150%. Bad debt at Chinese banks piled up across the board in 2014 as the Chinese economy put in its worst performance in more than two decades. The ratio of nonperforming loans at Chinese commercial banks rose to 1.29% at the end of 2014, the highest level in more than four years, according to bank regulators. At the end of 2013 the level was 1%. Mr. Song told reporters at the briefing that a 2% to 3% bad loan ratio is reasonable for Chinese lenders amid slower economic growth. The bank's net interest margin- the difference between interest paid and received--widened to 2.92% at the end of 2014 from 2.79% a year earlier, thanks to an improved lending structure and effective controls on funding costs, the bank said. Net interest margin is a key measure of profitability for Chinese lenders. Chinese banks' interest margins have come under pressure as the government loosens its controls over deposit rates. This year it could scrap those curbs entirely. Bank of China Ltd., China's No. 4 bank by assets, is set to release results on Wednesday, while No. 1 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. will announce its earnings on Thursday and No. 2 China Construction Bank Corp. will release results on Friday.

Michael Cashel, a senior vice president at Fidelity, will be Luminex's interim chief executive, these people said. The launch of the company faces some hurdles. The fund firms will be in direct competition with large banks that use their own dark pools and trading algorithms as ways to persuade firms to use them as brokers. UBS AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG run the largest dark pools in the U.S., according to data from Finra. Other independent operators such as BIDS Holding L.P. and Liquidnet Holdings Inc. also help facilitate trades between institutional buyers and sellers. About 14.4% of all stock trading took place in dark pools in the first quarter of 2014, according to Tabb Group. Representatives for UBS, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse declined to comment. Spokesmen for BIDS Holding and Liquidnet couldn't be reached for comment. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. recently has approached several of the banks to take over operation of their dark pools, and also plans to ask the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to do so, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. Fund firms are betting on the new venue to be different, particularly because of the widespread commitment from many large asset managers. The firms involved together manage many trillions of dollars through mutual funds, 401(k) plans and separate accounts for institutional investors, so the new venue has a higher chance of matching orders quickly and easily, these people said. Also, the new venue would operate almost at cost, allowing fund firms to save on fees at big banks. Fund firms that wish to join the venue would go through a rigorous process for approval, weeding out high-frequency traders, these people said. Not all big fund companies have signed on. Absent from the endeavor is Vanguard Group, the country's largest mutual-fund firm with about $3 trillion in assets under management. A Vanguard spokesman declined to comment. Participants of the new venue also don't plan to use it exclusively, according to these people. The debate over the fairness of trading in U.S. equity markets has been happening for the past several years, in part because of the release last year of the Michael Lewis book ""Flash Boys,"" which claimed the market is rigged in favor of high-frequency traders, banks and exchanges to the detriment of institutional and retail investors. At Fidelity, with about $2 trillion of assets under management, the effort to form a new trading venue was pushed in part by Chairman Edward C. ""Ned"" Johnson III, who stepped down as chief executive of the company last year. His daughter, Abigail ""Abby"" Johnson, has taken his place. Fidelity created a new division to house the project, the Journal has reported. Dark pools have recently run into trouble. Earlier this month UBS agreed to pay $14.4 million to settle allegations by the SEC that it didn't sufficiently disclose to all its clients how the dark pool worked, creating an uneven playing field. It was the largest penalty ever levied on an alternative trading system. A spokesman for UBS said in a statement that ""issues that led to these chargers were remedied in mid-2012."" Barclays PLC, which once ran one of the biggest such venues, saw its investors and brokers flee last summer after New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a civil lawsuit accusing the bank of allegedly catering to high-frequency traders even as it promised customers it would protect them. Barclays has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. A spokesman said in a statement that it ""is based on clear and substantial factual and legal errors."" Bradley Hope contributed to this article.

Doc_19,Car Loans See Rise In Missed Payments; Uptick Comes Amid Rise in Loans to Subprime Borrowers,"Alan Zibel Christina Rogers; Andriotis, AnnaMaria","According to third-quarter 2014 data from Experian, the industry leaders, excluding financing arms of car manufacturers, are Ally Financial Inc., with 7.31% of new-car loans, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. with 5.96%, Capital One Financial Corp. with 4.38%, Wells Fargo & Co. with 3.46% and TD Bank with 2.33%.","Borrowers who took out auto loans over the past year are missing payments at the highest level since the recession, fueling concerns among regulators, analysts and some in the car industry that practices that helped boost 2014 light-vehicle sales to a near-decade high could backfire. ""It's clear that credit quality is eroding now, and pretty quickly,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. More than 2.6% of car-loan borrowers who took out loans in the first quarter of last year had missed at least one monthly payment by November, the highest level of early loan trouble since 2008, when such delinquencies rose above 3%, according to an analysis of data performed for The Wall Street Journal by Moody's Analytics. The uptick comes amid an increase in subprime auto loans, raising concerns that car buyers may have taken on more debt than they can handle. For that set of borrowers, defined as consumers with a credit score lower than 620, loan performance also is deteriorating. More than 8.4% of borrowers with weak credit scores who took out loans in the first quarter of 2014 had missed payments by November, according to the Moody's analysis of Equifax credit-reporting data. That was the highest level since 2008, when early delinquencies for subprime borrowers rose above 9%. Car lenders say the concerns are overstated. ""Auto loans continue to perform well, as they did during the recession,"" said Bill Himpler, executive vice president of the American Financial Services Association, which represents auto lenders. ""Concerns about a spike in delinquencies have not been substantiated by evidence."" Overall auto-loan delinquencies have been running above year-ago levels but remain lower than during the recession. As of the third quarter, 3.4% of borrowers had missed at least one car-loan payment. That was up from 3.2% in the same quarter a year earlier but still below 4.2% in 2009, according to Experian Automotive. Consumer advocates, meanwhile, say car dealers and finance companies are being overly aggressive with low-income borrowers, pushing them to the limits of what they can afford. They point to borrowers like Patrina Thomas, 48 years old, from the Syracuse, N.Y., area. She said she was persuaded by a local car dealer to trade in her 2002 Jeep in the summer 2013 in favor of a used 2008 Chrysler Sebring, sold for more than $17,000 and financed with a 20.4% interest rate. Unable to make the $385-a-month payment, the car was repossessed last year. ""Now my credit is ruined,"" said Ms. Thomas, who still owes more than $7,600 on the car. ""I can't buy a house for a while."" Ms. Thomas's auto loan was financed by Chrysler Capital, a joint venture between the auto maker and Santander Consumer USA Holdings, a unit of Banco Santander SA. A spokeswoman for Santander declined to comment on the case or on the company's delinquency rates. According to third-quarter 2014 data from Experian, the industry leaders, excluding financing arms of car manufacturers, are Ally Financial Inc., with 7.31% of new-car loans, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. with 5.96%, Capital One Financial Corp. with 4.38%, Wells Fargo & Co. with 3.46% and TD Bank with 2.33%. In the used-car market, the leaders are Wells Fargo at 6.56%, Ally at 4.41% and Capital One at 4.35%. Ally Financial reported $355 million of its outstanding consumer car loans as nonperforming as of Sept. 30, according to its Securities and Exchange Commission filing. That is up 7.9% from the end of 2013. Its net charge-offs for car loans--the amount it is writing off as a loss because it doesn't expect to be paid back--were $341 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, up 18% from a year earlier. The increase in losses ""is related to growth in the consumer portfolio as well as our strategy to diversify the business and book a more balanced mix of assets,"" said Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Ally. ""The increase in losses was expected and in line with our expectations. We continue to have a robust underwriting policy and price for risk appropriately."" Of the 15 biggest U.S. auto-lending banks, Santander had the largest percentage of delinquent auto loans in the third quarter, according to SNL Financial. Santander's delinquency rate of 16.7% was followed by Capital One at 6.6%, according to SNL. In general, the auto-finance sector is one of the fastest-growing lending markets since the financial crisis, with outstanding loan balances hitting $943.8 billion at the end of September, from $809 billion two years earlier, according to the Federal Reserve. Since such loans have performed well in the past, lenders have been more willing to take risks on auto lending, while staying cautious on home mortgages, analysts say. Of particular concern are loans in which car dealers push financing at extended terms of six and seven years at relatively high interest rates, even if the borrowers have weak credit and escalated debt-to-income ratios. The longer loan terms keep monthly payments under control and get buyers to purchase more expensive cars. Low-interest rates and wider credit availability have helped propel the U.S. auto industry's comeback from the recession, driving new-car sales to 16.5 million last year, the highest level since 2006, according to market researcher Autodata Corp. To keep the momentum going in 2015, industry analysts said car companies and lenders will likely have to push more aggressive finance deals and tap borrowers with weaker credit. Riskier lending tactics already are drawing regulatory scrutiny. Federal bank regulators observed that lenders were weakening standards and taking on more risks about two years ago, said Darrin Benhart, deputy comptroller of supervision risk management for the Office of Comptroller of Currency, which regulates the largest U.S. banks. ""We're putting banks on notice that we have concerns,"" Mr. Benhart said. ""It's definitely an area that warrants some attention."" Several state and federal agencies also are investigating industry practices, particularly for subprime borrowers. The Justice Department last year sent subpoenas to Ally, General Motors Financial Inc. and Santander Consumer USA. The subpoenas ask them to turn over documents related to subprime-lending businesses. Kevin Duignan, global head of securitization for Fitch Ratings, said some bigger lenders are starting to pull back and be more conservative on subprime auto lending. The credit-rating firm is concerned that small and midsize lenders won't follow suit and dive too deeply into subprime lending. ""Subprime delinquencies and losses are beginning to grow at a more rapid pace than we've seen in a long time,"" he said. Losses on securities backed by prime and subprime auto loans were up in November, with subprime reaching levels not seen since early 2010, according to Fitch. Car loans didn't experience the surge in defaults that occurred in mortgage lending during the recession. If a loan does goes bad, it is easier to repossess and resell a car than a house or office building. The rise in delinquency rates shouldn't be surprising given the rebound in subprime lending, said Melinda Zabritski, director of automotive credit for Experian. Lending to below-prime borrowers accounted for about 23% of the vehicle-finance market in the third quarter, up from 21% in 2009 but still below pre-recession levels of 28% in 2007, according to Experian. Compared with the low point of six years ago, growth in such lending, ""may look extreme, which is why we recommend looking at a longer view,"" Ms. Zabritski said. Some auto-industry executives are nervous, saying the riskier practices can leave consumers upside down on their loans longer, owing more than their vehicle is worth when they are ready to trade in. ""The industry is starting to do some stupid things,"" said John Mendel, Honda's America's vice president of sales. The longer-term loans coupled with greater use of subprime financing can leave buyers paying interest rates as high as 22%, much higher than what is typical for prime buyers, he said. ""If you're going to trade in in the next six years, you're going to have a problem,"" Mr. Mendel said.

Elite Daily's founder, David Arabov, will continue to run the site but report to Mr. Steinberg. ""This marriage will permit Elite Daily to continue to flourish as a platform for and by Millennials, allowing us to expand internationally, grow our staff and continue to deliver the most relevant and engaging content for Millennials,"" he said in a message posted on the site. Daily Mail first established a presence in the U.S. in 2012 and has quickly become a new media force in America.

Another jobs-related report also suggested hiring eased in January, possibly lowering expectations for Friday's payrolls report. Private payrolls in the U.S. increased by 213,000 jobs in January, said the national employment report compiled by payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal projected ADP to report a larger January increase of 240,000 new private-sector jobs. The December ADP increase was revised up to 253,000 from 241,000. Falling energy prices are having an impact on hiring trends, the ADP report said. ""Businesses in the energy and supplying industries are already scaling back payrolls in reaction to the collapse in oil prices, while industries benefiting from the lower prices have been slower to increase their hiring,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, which calculates the ADP jobs numbers. Another report out Wednesday show a downshift in hiring. TrimTabs Investment Research said it estimates the U.S. economy added between 190,000 and 220,000 jobs in January. The privately sourced reports are released ahead of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment situation report scheduled for Friday. Economists think the BLS will report January nonfarm payrolls--which include government positions--expanded by 237,000 new positions. That would continue a 12-month string of solid hiring, but would be slower than the 252,000 new jobs added in December. The January unemployment rate is forecast to slip to 5.5% from 5.6%. Economists are unlikely to change their forecasts after seeing the ADP numbers. ""The ADP has had some problems seasonally adjusting its January numbers because employers often wait until the new year to purge their payroll records of employees who had left during the previous year,"" wrote Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in a research note. According to ADP, firms employing between 1-49 workers added 78,000 new workers last month. Medium-size businesses with payrolls of 50-499 workers increased payrolls by 95,000 employees. Large firms with 500 or more employees hired only 40,000 more workers. Service-sector payrolls increased by 183,000 workers in January. Manufacturing added only 14,000 jobs.

""We think the two payroll reports are especially prone to large deviations in Decembers because of some issues seasonally adjusting the ADP data at year-end,"" J.P. Morgan economist Daniel Silver wrote in a research note. In the past four Decembers, the initial ADP payroll number has been higher than the Labor Department's original number by an average of 124,000 jobs, say economists at CRT Capital Group. According to ADP, firms employing between 1-49 workers added 106,000 new workers last month. Medium-size businesses with payrolls of 50-499 workers increased payrolls by 70,000 employees. Large firms with 500 or more employees hired only 66,000 more workers. Service-sector payrolls increased by 194,000 workers in October. Manufacturing added 26,000 jobs. Construction payrolls increased by 23,000.

Doc_23,"Private-Sector Hiring Posts Modest Gain; ADP report says 212,000 jobs were added for February","Madigan, Kathleen","According to ADP, small businesses continue to lead hiring.","Business hiring remained modest last month, as expected by economists, an employment survey released Wednesday says. The gain was close to economists' expectations and unlikely will change forecasts for Friday's widely-watched employment report from the Labor Department. Private payrolls in the U.S. increased by 212,000 jobs in February, according to the national employment report compiled by payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal projected ADP to report a February gain of 215,000 private-sector slots. The January ADP increase was revised up to 250,000 from 213,000. The report said ""While February's job gains came in slightly lower than recent months, the trend of solid growth above 200,000 jobs a month continued."" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics that compiles the data for ADP, said, ""At the current pace of growth, the economy will return to full employment by mid-2016."" The ADP report is released ahead of Friday's employment report. Economists expect the Labor Department will report February nonfarm payrolls--which include government positions--increased by 240,000 positions, a bit slower than the 257,000 added in January. The February unemployment rate is forecast to slip back to 5.6% from 5.7% in January. The ADP report isn't seen changing forecasters' minds about Friday's data. ""This survey isn't reliable enough...to lead us to revise our forecast,"" wrote Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in a research note. According to ADP, small businesses continue to lead hiring. Firms employing between 1 and 49 workers added 94,000 new workers last month. Medium-size businesses with payrolls of 50-499 workers increased payrolls by 63,000 employees. Large firms with 500 or more employees hired 56,000 more workers. Manufacturing added only 3,000 jobs, said ADP. That small increase is consistent with Monday's report from the Institute for Supply Management that showed only a slight expansion in the payrolls of their factory members. Construction payrolls increased by 31,000, the same as in January. The February gain seemed ""high"" given the winter weather in much of the U.S., said economists at Stone McCarthy Research Associates. They think the Friday's report will show construction jobs increased just 11,000 last month. Service-sector payrolls increased by 181,000 workers in February, slower than the 200,000-plus pace in the previous three months. Later on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management said its readings on employment among non-manufacturers showed a pickup in employment in February.

Oxford, the real-estate arm of Canadian pension fund OMERS Worldwide Group of Companies, told The Wall Street Journal it purchased 92 Avenue de France from a joint venture between German companies GLL Real Estate and Union Investment Real Estate GmbH. Oxford made its first Paris acquisition in September. With its second deal the group is almost halfway to its [euro]1 billion, three-year target for the city. The rest of its [euro]3.6 billion portfolio of European real-estate assets are in London, where it set up an office in late 2008. ""If we're going to build a 10 billion Canadian dollar business (in Europe), it would be difficult just to focus on London,"" said Paul Brundage, senior managing director at Oxford. London is typically the first destination for global investors looking to establish a foothold in Europe. Oxford jointly developed the Leadenhall Building---popularly called the Cheesegrater---with British Land PLC. And Canadian firm Brookfield Property Partners LP and look likely to gain control of the Canary Wharf business district in a 2.6 billion deal. Paris, or German cities such as Munich or Frankfurt, are often the next targets for international investors when they decide to expand European portfolios. Over the last year, ""London has become more expensive than Paris,"" said Michel Vauclair, an executive at Oxford. He also noted that rates for long-term debt in euros are more favorable than in sterling. Global investors have injected $29.3 billion in London real estate in the last 12 months, compared with $13.2 billion into Paris, according to Real Capital Analytics data. With London's property market booming, it has been challenging to acquire high-quality assets preferred by pension funds, Mr. Brundage said. ""Not impossible, but challenging,"" he said, noting as demand pushes up prices, ""it's harder to meet total return expectations"" in the U.K. capital. The recovery in the Paris property market after the financial crisis has lagged behind London. Prime office rents in Paris fell 3.2% in the fourth quarter, and office vacancy rates increased to 5.2%, according to broker Savills. 92 Avenue de France is a 235,000 square foot office located just over a mile from the Gare de Lyon train station.

Doc_25,Real-Estate Investors Sing Praises of ECB's Bond Buys; Quantitative easing keeps rates low to keep the party going,"Grant, Peter; Patnaude, Art","Stephen Renna, chief executive of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council, has been moderating MIPIM panels since the early years of the bust and borrowers are no longer bemoaning the ""dearth of capital.""","CANNES, France--The crowds of real-estate executives gathered here on the Riviera this week for an annual conference had reason to celebrate even before they arrived. On Monday, a day before the four-day MIPIM conference began, the European Central Bank started its aggressive bond-buying program known as quantitative easing . That was good news for the 21,000 investors, developers, brokers, architects, planners and others from 93 countries meeting along La Croisette, Cannes' beachfront promenade, and in the long lines of yachts leased by Europe's biggest real-estate companies. While there are still plenty of concerns in Cannes--such as the violence in Ukraine and threat of economic upheaval in Greece--the ECB's bond buying means the low interest rates that have fueled the sharp rise in deals and values across much of Europe will likely continue. Property is attractive to investors when rates are low because the cash flow from buildings is better than bond yields. ""Quantitative easing will only increase the amount of money coming in,"" said Scott Brown, chief executive of Hartford, Conn.-based Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers LLC, which expanded into Europe in 2010. The year already is off to a good start after the market logged a postcrash record volume of property sales in 2014. In the first two months of 2015, investors purchased [euro]26.5 billion ($28.3 billion) in European real estate, up from [euro]25 billion in January and February last year, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics. American investors in particular are on a buying spree thanks to the strong dollar. For example, in the biggest deal so far this year, Dallas-based private-equity firm Lone Star Funds purchased a portfolio of U.K. property from the Moorfield Group Ltd., a real-estate fund manager, for [euro]1.27 billion, according to Real Capital. The properties included Salisbury House, an office building in London's financial district, and Pinnacle, a mixed-use building in Leeds. New groups of Asian investors also are showing up in major European cities. In London, Chinese insurer Ping An purchased Tower Place, the Safra family purchased the tower known as the Gherkin and the headquarters of HSBC Holdings PLC was sold to a Qatari buyer. Investors are bullish on European property partly because, with the economies of many European countries poised for more solid recoveries, they see opportunities to increase building occupancies, rents and cash flows. For example, CBRE Group Inc.'s asset-management arm is planning to buy about [euro]4 billion in of European property this year, up from [euro]3 billion in 2014, partly because of these improving fundamentals. CBRE will be focusing partly on retail as well as distribution facilities that are moving closer to population centers to cut down delivery time to online shoppers, said Sophie van Oosterom, chief investment officer of CBRE Global Investors in Europe. ""We will diligently be seeking out locations where rental growth can be obtained,"" she said. Another big topic of conversation in Cannes: debt financing is becoming more plentiful. Stephen Renna, chief executive of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council, has been moderating MIPIM panels since the early years of the bust and borrowers are no longer bemoaning the ""dearth of capital."" Today there is ample capital available from banks from nontraditional lenders like private-equity firms and insurance companies, Mr. Renna said. That, along with rising property values, has closed the gap that existed for much of the downturn between how much borrowers needed and the available funding, he said. Now, said Mr. Renna, ""it's a good time to be a borrower."" Of course, not everyone at MIPIM has voiced optimism. For example, Reds S.A., the development arm of Ellaktor SA, a large Greek construction company, was in Cannes partly to find investors for a proposed retail development on a former winery near Athens. But because of the political and economic uncertainty hanging over Greece, ""people are postponing the conversation,"" said Romanos Savopoulos, a spokesman for Reds. ""They're waiting to see what's going to actually happen."" Also, many at MIPIM pointed out that the ECB's bond-buying program, and a long period of low interest rates, might cause problems in the future. ""I'm fearful [bond-buying] will just make money available for existing assets, leading to an over-appreciation, rather than leading to the development of new, productive assets,"" said Walter Boettcher, head of research at Colliers International. When interest rates do eventually go up, it could be a catalyst for the next downturn, Mr. Bottcher said. But with economic growth still weak, ""rates aren't going up anytime soon.""

Doc_26,"Soybeans' Rally Runs Out of Steam; As oilseeds flow to Brazilian ports again, prices sink","Newman, Jesse",None available.,"CHICAGO--The rally in soybeans ended as suddenly as it began. A work stoppage by truckers in Brazil blocked soybean deliveries to ports and helped send prices to a seven-week high of $10.371_ÅÊ4 a bushel last Monday. By Friday, many of the truckers had returned to work and prices had fallen 5% as investors refocused on slowing demand for U.S. supplies and the advancing harvest in South America. Soybeans are again flowing from inland farms to coastal ports in Brazil, the second-largest exporter of the oilseed after the U.S., supplying shippers with crops to load onto cargoes bound overseas. ""Trucks full of soybeans are now hogging the roads to the ports,"" said Rich Nelson, director of research at commodities advisory firm Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Ill. Soybeans for March delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade ended Friday at $9.791_ÅÊ4 a bushel, the lowest price since Feb. 11. The resumed Brazilian deliveries come amid a slump in demand for U.S. soybeans. Weekly data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed 23.3 million bushels of soybeans had been inspected for export in the week ended Feb. 26, down 35% from the week before, to the lowest level since last September, analysts said. ""We're seeing a definite waning in U.S. export shipments,"" said Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst for brokerage Jefferies LLC in New York. Though foreign demand for U.S. soybeans has been robust, global importers such as China typically shift their purchases to South America as harvest there picks up pace and crops come online. However, last week China lowered its economic growth forecast to about 7% for 2015, suggesting a bleaker outlook for demand from the world's largest buyer of the oilseeds, analysts said. A plunging Brazilian currency has also pressured soybean prices, providing Brazilian farmers with an incentive to sell crops overseas in competition with the U.S. The dollar last week rose 7.7% against the real, which fell to its lowest level in more than a decade, increasing profits for farmers as they converted their dollar-priced commodities such as soybeans into the local currency. ""Soybeans have been crashing pretty hard,"" said David Durra, principal of AgSpread Analytics Inc., a commodity-trading firm in Chicago. For now, Brazilian farmers are selling crops because they ""receive more reais for each bushel of beans,"" he said. Prices for the oilseeds could see a bounce this week; In a closely watched crop report, the USDA is expected to clip estimates for domestic soybean stockpiles, pegging inventories at the end of the 2014-15 season on Aug. 31 at 379 million bushels, down from its February estimate of 385 million, according to analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. Still, analysts think any upswing in prices will be short-lived, barring future supply disruptions in South America, since soybean reserves still would be more than four times as large as last year. ""The rally in February may have cannibalized the market,"" Ms. Frick said. ""It's possible we have the spring high in place."" Jeffrey T. Lewis contributed to this article.

Doc_27,Calling the Super Bowl Like Cris Collinsworth; NBC Analyst Breaks Down Endless Hours of Tape; Watching 'Inside-Out',"Clark, Kevin","At his Cincinnati home, Collinsworth is breaking down Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman's impressive first-quarter interception in his team's NFC Championship Game win over the Green Bay Packers. When Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril makes a nice move against the Packers, he notes that Avril was ""borderline unblockable"" in last year's Super Bowl and that his pressure on Peyton Manning was wildly overlooked as a key to the win.","Cincinnati In the two weeks before the Super Bowl, the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks are combing through endless amounts of tape. They are memorizing until they have instant recall to make split-second decisions and they are highlighting the mismatches between the two teams. Cris Collinsworth is doing the same thing. The NBC analyst will be calling his third Super Bowl Sunday, along with Al Michaels, who will be calling his ninth. But it isn't getting any easier. It's Collinsworth's job to explain football to the 110 million or so watching Sunday. That presents problems. At his Cincinnati home, Collinsworth is breaking down Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman's impressive first-quarter interception in his team's NFC Championship Game win over the Green Bay Packers. He identifies the key components. Sherman is covering Packers wide receiver Davante Adams one-on-one. Defensive tackle Landon Cohen moves from the middle of the defensive line out into the open field to cover wide receiver Randall Cobb out of the backfield. Safety Earl Thomas is lined up deep, while the other safety, Kam Chancellor, is ""underneath"" in the coverage, he notes. Sherman's coverage allows them to play zone defense on one side of the field ""with some help,"" he says. Then he notes, once the ball is snapped, Thomas runs to the side opposite Sherman to disrupt the Packers' timing. Collinsworth said there is brilliance in what is going on: Every player on the field has ""help"" behind him except Sherman, who wants the ball thrown in his direction. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers takes the bait and throws the interception. ""Now,"" Collinsworth said. ""Tell me how you are going to get all that on television? You don't."" He said if he breaks down that key play during the Super Bowl telecast, he'd get 15 seconds to talk. ""So you'd have to only focus in on Sherman and what he did down here. That's the essence of the play."" This is life for Collinsworth, who, before a given game, spends about six hours watching film of each team's offense and defense, then countless more studying anything else he can find. That doesn't include the hours talking to each team's head coach and coordinators. ""How I do this is how I did law school,"" said Collinsworth, who studied law at the University of Cincinnati. ""You start with 50 pages of notes that turn into 25 pages of notes that turn into 10 pages of notes that turn into five pages, then you try to memorize them for the game."" But tape study is the backbone of the preparation. In his office in Cincinnati, Collinsworth has four laptops firing at any given time. He has a hand-held clicker that allows him to quickly rewind a play--sometimes he'll watch the same one double-digit times. Once he notices something worth covering in the play, he speaks into a recorder which will eventually send voice notes to Michaels, NBC reporter Michele Tafoya, coordinating producer Fred Gaudelli and director Drew Esocoff. The notes can be identifying potential problems for the next opponent, or a notable thing about a player he noticed on film. He has a voice-recognition system that helps him transcribe his thoughts, but it's a work in progress. Patriots star tight end Rob Gronkowski, in the voice-recognition system, became both ""Run Cows"" and ""Gatuski."" When Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril makes a nice move against the Packers, he notes that Avril was ""borderline unblockable"" in last year's Super Bowl and that his pressure on Peyton Manning was wildly overlooked as a key to the win. He peruses Pro Football Focus--an analytics company in which he is an investor--to find out trends over time. One he quickly noticed while breaking down the Seahawks' defense is star defensive lineman Michael Bennett's tendency to jump offsides. ""So right away, I know that's a story line for the Super Bowl. Can they get him offsides? He wants sacks, he wants to be MVP,"" he said. ""Can the Patriots get him to jump?"" Former Oakland Raiders coach John Madden, a longtime broadcasting legend, taught Collinsworth the most valuable lessons in his film study. The first is on how his eyes should progress when he's watching a play. ""He told me to watch the game inside-out,"" Collinsworth said. That means to watch the interior of the offensive line--what is the guard doing? Where are the offensive linemen headed? That, he said, will tell you what's going to happen in the rest of the play. He said his eyes do generally follow that rule, but as a former Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver, he admits he first looks at the defensive pass coverages ""just to guess."" ""I lived with the passing game so it's a little easier for me to pick up on the secondary than what's going on inside,"" he said. He said the study is actually the easy part of the week. Saturday and Sunday bring new stresses. There is last minute film-study and meetings to try to get everything in order. Then there is the truly hard part: the memorization meetings. Collinsworth and his information guru, Andy Freeland, meet in a room and go over everything--everything--that he should have memorized. But the memorization brings its own problems. Collinsworth said Madden taught him ""not to fall in love with preparation."" If you are too confident in your preparation, Collinsworth said, you won't notice the subtle differences in the game. He does admit some nerves going into the game--adding that there are now ""two million people"" who are ready to analyze every word spoken on the Internet. ""It's high-stakes poker for everyone involved, for the two teams, the coaches--every mistake they make is going to be news, national news,"" he said. ""Same goes for us: The Super Bowl is a different deal.""

Doc_28,CIO Journal: News Digest,Anonymous,None available.,"CIOs Leery of Sharing Cyberthreat Information U.S. President Barack Obama on Tuesday proposed legislation to encourage cybersecurity information-sharing by the private sector and government. Chief information officers and security experts say they are encouraged by the idea, but its success will depend largely on making companies comfortable sharing sensitive information in the first place. A comfortable, safe way to share cybersecurity lessons and best practices with the government sounds like a good idea to Stephen Hagood, CIO of global manufacturer Ingersoll Rand PLC. The company participates in an industry-specific information-sharing group and works with consulting partners to set up sharing sessions with certain companies. Other than that, ""We don't tend to share too much information unsolicited,"" he said. ""I think we're all a little shy about wanting to share too much."" The reasons for not wanting to share are numerous. Many companies aren't sure the information will be protected, or worry that it could put them out of regulatory compliance. Some are concerned about inadvertently sharing intellectual property with rivals, or fear the reputational risks associated with disclosing an attack. Others aren't convinced the information the government shares with them will be particularly useful. ""In order for us to do more information sharing, I think the government would need to take a very proactive lead role in sharing what they know with companies and CIOs,"" Mr. Hagood said. The president's proposal encourages companies to share cyberthreat information with the Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center. DHS would then share that information ""in as close to real-time as practicable"" with relevant federal agencies and private-sector information-sharing organizations. To protect consumers, firms would have to comply with privacy restrictions such as removing unnecessary personal information from the data being shared, the White House said. Dow Chemical Co. CIO Paula Tolliver said she sees information-sharing as a way the good guys can help the good guys. Still, there are certain pieces of information she doesn't want to share with competitors or other outside entities. ""It's a balance like anything else,"" she said. ""You learn which relationships are the most helpful and where the sharing is mutually beneficial."" Steven Norton Hachette Will Spread IT Staff Across Company Hachette Book Group CIO Ralph Munsen plans to start embedding information-technology analysts throughout the firm in an effort he hopes will give the publisher more time to focus on the creative projects that make up its lifeblood. Ten business analysts will be assigned to functions like finance, sales and marketing, and production. There, the analysts will support IT needs in those areas and gain expertise on the system, or set of systems, their division uses most. Within their assigned groups, analysts will be responsible for understanding how business divisions actually use the systems they have. Analysts also will be assigned a secondary system to learn, and will rotate every six months or so to preserve institutional knowledge, Mr. Munsen said. ""Everyone gets to know everyone else's stuff, and we have a view of how the entire company operates."" The benefits are many, he said. Embedding IT staffers throughout the firm could cut turnaround time on projects and give IT an on-the-ground view of business processes. It also could reinforce technology's strategic role within Hachette, which is part of Lagardêëre SCA. The publisher is boosting its analytics and business intelligence capabilities as it looks for insight on every aspect of the book process. During last year's contract negotiations with Amazon.com Inc., IT supported the pricing team as the two companies swapped terms back and forth, Mr. Munsen said.

Doc_29,"Cybercriminals Are Misappropriating Businesses' Web Addresses; As a Result, Customers Can't Find the Real Companies on the Web","Simon, Ruth","[...]Premier's domain registration had expired after someone shifted the email associated with it to ""a weird, shady Hotmail account"" overseas, Premier co-owner John Reed says.","Cybercriminals targeting businesses are stealing more than customer passwords and credit-card numbers these days. Some are misappropriating the very Web addresses--or domain names--of the businesses themselves. When Pablo Palatnik of Miami glanced at a Google analytics report showing Web traffic on his office TV monitor one day last month, he was alarmed to discover that traffic to his business website, Shadesdaddy.com, had plunged 80% from its usual level of as many as 10,000 visitors a day. At first, the 32-year-old entrepreneur suspected a server had gone down. But after digging further, he discovered a more serious problem. A cyberthief had diverted his company's domain name--the very Web address that's critical to his firm's online sales--to China. That meant that potential customers surfing the Web for Oakley, Ray-Ban, Versace and other popular sunglass brands couldn't find his eight-year-old Internet retail business. ""I never thought someone could steal the domain from us,"" he says. Mr. Palatnik's experience underscores a little-noticed and growing security risk for business owners. Thieves can hijack domain names and transfer them to such places as China, Eastern Europe and Russia in what appears to be ""organized criminal activity,"" says Philip Corwin, counsel to the Internet Commerce Association, a trade association for domain-name investors and developers. The nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, coordinates how Web addresses are allocated, and it has gotten over 140 complaints about domain-name thefts in the past 20 months. The thief might hold the domain name for ransom, resell it or use the information to get access to personal or company data, says David Weslow, an Internet attorney in Washington. Thieves may ""also be interested in other means for monetizing the stolen domain name, such as the display of pay-per-click advertisements, display of a website that downloads malware, or use of the domain name to send legitimate-looking emails containing spam, viruses and/or phishing correspondence,"" he says. At least 15 cases seeking the return of domain names were filed in U.S. courts last year, up from five in 2013 and 10 in 2012, according to Stevan Lieberman, a Washington attorney who represents domain-name holders. The figures don't include state-court cases or disputes that didn't result in litigation. Small firms with memorable domain names--as well as entrepreneurs who snap up particular domain names with plans to resell them--can be especially vulnerable because they tend to have less sophisticated Internet security systems. Entrepreneurs routinely pay thousands of dollars to obtain their domain names, or Web addresses. The most sought-after domain names can fetch millions of dollars, but the median price for a domain name was $3,000 in 2014, up 9% from a year earlier, according to DNJournal.com, an industry magazine.Earlier this year, an eight-person home-health-aide startup in McLean, Va., paid $350,000 to acquire homecare.com. Cybercriminals sometimes hijack domain names by scraping public directories listing contact data for domain owners. These hackers then send out phishing emails designed to surreptitiously capture a domain owner's keystrokes or passwords, according to Enrico Schaefer, a Traverse City, Mich., attorney who specializes in Internet law. Using that data, the hackers can take control of the business domain name by transferring it to another registrar using an account controlled by a cybercriminal. ""Your GoDaddy service(s) shown below has been suspended because some of the purchases on your account remain unpaid,"" said a recent e-mail to a GoDaddy customer. The email, which appeared to be part of a phishing scam, told the reader to click on a link ""to make payment and reinstate your services."" A spokeswoman for GoDaddy Inc., the technology company that helps individuals and businesses create an online presence, says it is investigating the notice, adding that it ""clearly appears to us to be a scam email."" At 14-employee Premier Machine Products Inc., in Kirtland, Ohio, e-mail traffic suddenly dried up in mid-November. Soon, its customers complained that emails and purchase orders to the maker of custom screw-machine products had bounced back. In fact, Premier's domain registration had expired after someone shifted the email associated with it to ""a weird, shady Hotmail account"" overseas, Premier co-owner John Reed says. Premier didn't receive notices to renew its domain registration because of the email-address switch, he says. The Federal Bureau of Investigation says it has opened roughly 26 complaints involving domain-name theft or hijacking in the past year. In addition, the Internet Crime Complaint Center, a partnership between the FBI and the nonprofit National White Collar Crime Center, has received 17 complaints of domain hijacking or theft. Nine of those reported a combined $3.5 million in losses. Some argue that ICANN itself should do more to monitor--and address--the illegal transfer of stolen domain names to registry holders abroad. ""If they find there are bad registrars working with bad folks to facilitate domain hijacking,"" taking steps to ""put them out of business would send a very strong message,"" says Mr. Corwin of the Internet Commerce Association. The registrar-accreditation agreement between ICANN and the registrars--the companies responsible for domain-name registration--gives ICANN enforcement powers to stop reported domain-name abuse, says a law-enforcement official with knowledge of the issue. But ICANN denies that it has that power. ""ICANN is not a regulatory authority or a law-enforcement agency,"" says Gwen Carlson, the agency's communications director. ""We do not regulate content, and we do not have broad general rights to police domain-name abuse."" In Burr Ridge, Ill., Michael Lee, the owner of the five-person Michael Lee + Associates advertising agency, spent roughly $15,000 and 19 months to regain control of MLA.com after it was hijacked and shifted to a registrar in the Bahamas in May 2013. Revenue fell 30% during the period because clients had difficulty reaching the company. Shortly before the judge's ruling in Mr. Lee's favor, someone claiming to have legitimately purchased the domain offered to return it in exchange for $15,000 or $20,000, he says. In Miami, ShadesDaddy.com was offline for 11 days. It lost about $50,000 in revenue, Mr. Palatnik estimates, prompting him to lay off six of his eight employees. He finally regained ShadesDaddy.com after filing an administrative action proving he was the rightful owner with VeriSign Inc., which maintains the definitive list of domain names that end in .com, his attorney says. Mr. Palatnik recently rehired the laid-off employees and is trying to regain the business's search-engine rankings. ""It's like your house got stolen,"" he says.

In London, a Chinese developer's 500 million ($768 million) proposal to rebuild the historical Crystal Palace in Hyde Park crumbled after it missed a deadline for filing plans. In Australia, the government ordered a Chinese conglomerate to sell a $31 million house it recently bought, citing restrictions against foreign buyers. Detroit is home to one of the knottiest cases. A Shanghai developer two years ago paid $9.4 million for the landmark David Stott Building as part of a bet on a Motor City renaissance. Today, the building is empty, and the developer has gone to court with former tenants including a bar and a yoga studio. In February, a frozen pipe burst and filled the bottom two floors with 450,000 gallons of water, prompting the last tenant to leave, according to the remaining tenants and the developer. The developer, Shanghai-based DongDu International Group, said it had decided not to renew any leases so that it can overhaul the building faster. China is snapping up properties abroad as developers look to diversify away from the sluggish Chinese property market and wealthy Chinese look to shift their money out of the country. In some places, like the U.S., property investment also is a quick route to residency status . Most of these investments appear to have gone smoothly. Research firm Real Capital Analytics says only four of 173 Chinese foreign-property acquisitions it follows have become distressed, largely because the buyers are well-capitalized. Rhodium Group, a research firm that tracks Chinese investment abroad, says the wave of Chinese property buying abroad accelerated only about two years ago and so far lacks a track record. Still, many developers, investors and others in real estate question whether the influx of Chinese developers has been too swift, said Urban Land Institute, a nonprofit research group based in Washington. The group in a recent report cited potential complications for deals including legal and cultural differences, the potential for overpaying for land and a preference for selling apartments to Chinese buyers before they are completed. ""In the U.S., there are more layers of complexities that can't be as easily resolved with a discussion with government officials,"" said Joel Rothstein, a partner at law firm Paul Hastings, who has helped Chinese firms structure property deals abroad. The purchase of Detroit's David Stott Building represented a bet by Dongdu International that a city hit hard by a slump in the auto industry would rebound. DongDu also purchased the long-vacant 14-story Detroit Free Press Building for $4.2 million and the 10-story Capitol Park Lofts, which sits on the site of Michigan's original Capitol Building, for nearly $2.8 million. On a recent visit to the David Stott Building, two gray pipes snaked down over the building's front entrance. The martini glass on the cocktail bar's neon sign had long since gone dark. The 38-story Art Deco building, named for a local flour miller and opened in 1929, lost tenants in recent decades amid Detroit's long economic slump. When DongDu purchased it in October 2013, it had been owned by Emre Uralli and his wife, Lynn Kassotis Uralli, who remained the owner of SkyBar, a cocktail bar on the 33rd floor that had premises on the ground floor and basement as well. At the time the building had nine tenants, according to DongDu. Two months after DongDu took control, the Detroit Fire Department shut down Skybar's operations on the 33rd floor, saying the business's temporary occupancy certificate had lapsed. Ms. Kassotis Uralli sued DongDu, alleging the Chinese company was obligated to obtain the certificate. ""We are not responsible"" for obtaining a certificate, said Ken Creighton, vice president at DongDu's asset-management arm. DongDu later countersued Skybar for allegedly not paying rent and to evict Skybar. Ms. Kassotis Uralli says DongDu rejected her January 2014 rent so she put it in an escrow account. Detroit Yoga, another tenant, closed its studio in January 2014 and sued DongDu for various issues. A local court dismissed the case in February. Last month, a burst pipe flooded the basement and knocked out the mechanical and electrical systems. Philip Lauri, a director at an advertising firm occupying the 28th story, said he and his staff had to move out. ""I'm uncertain if we are able to move back,"" said Mr. Lauri. ""We are working to ensure that Philip and his team suffer as little as possible through the inconvenience of the flood in accordance with the provisions in his existing lease,"" said Mr. Creighton.

Doc_31,"Should Harvard Business School Hit Refresh? Students, Faculty and Alumni Say School Is Behind in Tech","Korn, Melissa; Gellman, Lindsay","[...]competitors like Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management have established themselves as pre-eminent tech-industry feeders, according to the schools' annual career reports.","Does Harvard Business School need to hit refresh? The institution that required students to carry laptops as early as 1984 and sent graduates to top posts at Hewlett-Packard Co. and Facebook Inc. is not keeping up when it comes to teaching management in a tech-focused era, say students, faculty and alumni. Meanwhile, competitors like Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management have established themselves as pre-eminent tech-industry feeders, according to the schools' annual career reports. To be sure, HBS is still in high demand among b-school applicants, and it accepts only 12% of those who apply to its two-year M.B.A. program. But the school's size and legacy may complicate its attempts to keep ahead of rapid changes in technology and business. Compared with MIT and Stanford, ""we have, in a sense, less tech in the air,"" says the business school's dean, Nitin Nohria, though he points out that HBS sends many graduates to leading tech companies each year. Students, faculty and alums say HBS's strict adherence to the case-study teaching method focuses on business dilemmas from years or decades past, rather than the current forces shaping the business of technology, which include issues in which graduates are expected to be well versed. Nick Taranto, a 2010 HBS grad and co-founder and co-CEO of Plated Inc., an online food-delivery startup, says the school prepared him to run his organization, which employs about 300. ""But preparing for early-stage product management, customer discovery, user experience, Web design--what's the difference between HTML, CSS, Java Script--I had no idea,"" he says. ""I had to learn all of that on my own."" Echoes a 2014 graduate whose employer requested he remain anonymous, ""HBS trains people to be CEOs, CMOs, every sort of C except the CTO or the CIO role."" Few are calling for mandatory coding classes for M.B.A.s or special treatment for applicants with engineering backgrounds. But current students and recent graduates say HBS should fold more technological awareness into its core curriculum, addressing, for example, data analytics in marketing or the impact of Airbnb Inc.'s growth on major hotel chains. HBS has taken some steps to freshen its offerings. In 2013, Mr. Nohria launched the Digital Initiative, a cross-disciplinary project intended to help shape conversations about the digital transformation taking place in all corners of the economy. And the school recently announced it will start offering a business-focused version of the undergraduate school's popular introductory class in computer science. This year, about 25 HBS students cross-registered for the undergraduate course. Colin Maclay, who runs the digital initiative, says the group provides structure to tech initiatives, including research and courses. He helped organize a summit in April to discuss the challenges posed by digital transformation in business and points to about a dozen other events this year. One recent graduate who is now in a technology leadership role at a New York company says a nebulous ""initiative"" doesn't amount to progress. ""They've been having conversations for years,"" the graduate says of the school's efforts to expand its tech offerings. ""Nothing's happened."" One issue, Mr. Nohria says, is geography. MIT and Stanford's engineering and business schools are near one another and tightly integrated; by contrast, Harvard's engineering school is a nearly mile-long trek across the Charles River from HBS. A planned relocation of the engineering school will put it right across the street from HBS in a few years, a move that Mr. Nohria says will facilitate opportunities for students to learn programming and take courses on breakthrough innovations in science. Regina Herzlinger, who teaches about health care, says that crossing the Charles River to meet with non-M.B.A. students ""is really like a biblical crossing,"" confounding many collaborations. She's pushing to create a joint degree program with the business and engineering or medical schools, similar to ones at MIT and Stanford, a task that may be easier, she says, after the move. As for the case studies, the dean notes that faculty have been writing up-to-date cases involving digital issues, although some students complain that the cases are stale by the time they make it into the syllabus. (The issues facing HBS are common to much of academe: How to reconcile the teaching of time-tested lessons with the pace of real-world developments?) Marco Iansiti, who heads the school's Technology and Operations Management unit, estimates that about two-thirds of his department's required first-year course still focuses on operations, including a 12-hour exercise that simulates managing a factory floor. The class covered networked-based businesses and crowdsourcing for the first time this fall, and Prof. Iansiti says he's interested in adding more technology-management content and ""winding down a bit on traditional operations management."" The HBS electives that address technology management are overwhelmed, faculty say. When Karim Lakhani and Prof. Iansiti first offered their ""Digital Innovation and Transformation"" elective last spring, they signed up two 90-student sections and had a wait list long enough to fill a third one. Demand is also high for a ""Product Management 101"" course co-taught for the past two years by Prof. Thomas Eisenmann and Prem Ramaswami, a Google Inc. product manager. The 45 students take an idea from concept to product launch, learning how the Internet works and being coached on asking questions about products and user experience. Mr. Ramaswami says the goal is to prepare students to be product managers, or at least to understand how developers think. The student newspaper, Harbus, ran a story at the end of 2013 highlighting student discontent with a ""technology skills gap"" and a perceived lack of action by the administration to change that. As more M.B.A.s seek careers in tech, applicants with such aspirations are now thinking Silicon Valley rather than Boston, says Jeremy Shinewald, founder and president of mbaMission, an admission consulting firm. Of the small number of people who win admission to both HBS and Stanford, tech-minded candidates generally opt for Stanford, Mr. Shinewald says. But HBS students still fare well in the tech-job market, with recent graduates landing roles at firms like LinkedIn Corp., Google and Uber Technologies Inc. For now, many students are going outside the classroom for a tech fix. The 500-member student technology club hosted three learn-to-code workshops last year, all of which were oversubscribed. Prof. Iansiti displays a framed copy of the Harbus article on a bookcase in his office, set among student startup mementos and early Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. products. ""I loved the fact that students are excited about digital transformation,"" he says. ""At the same time, it's a reminder: Am I working hard enough to make change happen?""

Doc_32,"The Algorithm That Tells the Boss Who Might Quit; Wal-Mart, Credit Suisse crunch data to see which workers are likely to leave or stay","Silverman, Rachel Emma; Waller, Nikki","Corporate data crunchers play with dozens of factors, which may include job tenure, geography, performance reviews, employee surveys, communication patterns and even personality tests to identify flight risks, a term human-resources departments sometimes use for people likely to leave.","Employers want to know who has one foot out the door. As turnover becomes a bigger worry--and expense--in a tightening labor market, companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Box Inc. are analyzing a vast array of data points to determine who is likely to leave a post. The idea, say people who run analytics teams, is to give managers early warning so they can take action before employees jump ship. Corporate data crunchers play with dozens of factors, which may include job tenure, geography, performance reviews, employee surveys, communication patterns and even personality tests to identify flight risks, a term human-resources departments sometimes use for people likely to leave. The data often reveal a complex picture of what motivates workers to stay--and what causes them to look elsewhere. At Box, for example, a worker's pay or relationship with his boss matters far less than how connected the worker feels to his team, according to an analysis from human-resources analytics firm Culture Amp. At Credit Suisse, managers' performance and team size turn out to be surprisingly powerful influences, with a spike in attrition among employees working on large teams with low-rated managers. Human-resources software company Ultimate Software Group Inc. assigns clients' employees, and even its own workers, individual ""retention predictor"" numbers, similar to a credit score, to indicate the likelihood that a worker will leave. As the employment picture improves, companies are focusing more on retaining workers, largely because replacing them is costly. The median cost of turnover for most jobs is about 21% of an employee's annual salary, according to the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank.And it can cost, on average, some $3,341 to hire a new employee, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. William Wolf, Credit Suisse's global head of talent acquisition and development, says a one-point reduction in unwanted attrition rates saves the bank $75 million to $100 million a year. No single piece of data predicts whether an employee will stay or go, though many employers wish it were so. Data scientists create models to predict which workers might leave a company in the near future, combining a range of variables and testing the predictions over time. They might refine the calculations depending on which variables are most predictive for a given company or group of employees. ""One of the things that people want to find is that one nugget, that key thing that correlates with someone leaving, but it is never that simple,"" says Thomas Daglis, a data scientist at Ultimate Software. Employers may not mind that some employees are at risk of leaving, though companies stress that they are using the data to find ways to improve retention, and not nudge people out. Those caveats aside, data scientists who study retention say they have found some meaningful correlations. VoloMetrix Inc., which examines HR data as well as anonymized employee email and calendar data, found that it could predict flight risk up to a year in advance for employees who were spending less time interacting with certain colleagues or attending events beyond required meetings. And Ultimate Software found a correlation between a client's employees who waived their benefits coverage and those who left the company. The big challenge for employers is what, exactly, to do with the information. Some aren't sure how to approach employees at risk of leaving. ""Our goal is to never say the only reason we are coming to talk to you is because an algorithm told us to do so,"" says John Callery, director of people analytics at AOL Inc., which recently started working with workforce analytics firm Visier Inc. on a program to help predict attrition down to the individual employee. Mr. Callery says it is too early to tell whether AOL's retention figures will improve, or by how much, since it takes at least a year to test a predictive model. For the past three years, Credit Suisse has studied what happens to employees over time, including raises, promotions and life transitions, to predict whether they will choose to stay or leave the bank in the subsequent year. Changing jobs makes people ""sticky,"" or likely to stay on, says Mr. Wolf, who oversees the bank's people analytics team. Yet as recently as five years ago, fewer than half of open jobs at the bank were posted, and most went to outsiders. About a year and a half ago, the bank launched a global effort allowing its workers to raise their hands for internal moves. Credit Suisse recruiters now post 80% of open jobs, and cold-call employees when jobs open up. After observing that some who volunteered to be considered for internal moves ended up leaving for jobs elsewhere, bank recruiters began using attrition probability estimates in deciding which employees to target when positions opened up. Some 300 people have been promoted through the internal program; many of those people, Mr. Wolf says, might have left otherwise. ""We believe we've saved a number of them from taking jobs at other banks."" Credit Suisse also used analytics to investigate why women with certain job titles left the company at higher rates than men, and determined that transitions--whether a promotion or a personal milestone, such as a maternity leave--increased the probability of a woman deciding to leave. To kindle closeness among team members, and help forestall attrition, Box has encouraged managers to throw more social events, recognize team-based work and hold more mentoring meetings between senior leaders and newer employees. Since workers were more likely to leave if they didn't see clear career opportunities at the company, it has sought to improve at pointing out career possibilities for individual workers and encouraging ""stretch"" assignments. Semiconductor maker Micron Technology Inc. is using data in its efforts to reduce turnover among first-year employees, who have about a 20% world-wide attrition rate, largely driven by manufacturing personnel. Among its early findings, Micron discovered that workers were more likely to leave if they felt their job hadn't been accurately described when they were hired, so the company is trying to create clearer job descriptions. Micron also found that people who relocated for a job were more likely to leave, but it isn't sure why. ""It's very delicate how you approach things,"" says Timothy Long, the company's director of workforce analytics and systems. ""The idea is to determine, what can we do to get [people] to stay?"" Companies also are trying to predict when workers might leave their positions, but not necessarily the company. Wal-Mart is trying to determine in advance which employees are likely to get promoted so that it can line up replacements more quickly. The company says it promotes some 160,000 to 170,000 people a year. ""If we can tell three months in advance [that a position is going to be open], we can start hiring and training people. You don't want the jobs vacant for that long a time,"" says Elpida Ormanidou, Wal-Mart's vice president of global people analytics.

Doc_33,Europe's 2015 Tech Startup Landscape; Technology M&A and stock flotations are expected to have a banner year,"Mizroch, Amir",None available.,"Europe lacks its very own Facebook, Google or Twitter, but if the volume of new venture capital backing technology startups on the continent is any guide, there could be one in the making. European venture-capital investment last year reached its highest level since the dot-com boom, on the back of a healthy market for initial public offerings. Successful technology startups are bursting out of the tech hubs of London, Stockholm and Tel Aviv, among other cities. Innovative young companies from the broader reaches of Europe, the Middle East and Africa are helping fill up The Wall Street Journal's billion-dollar startup club . What's still up for debate is whether Europe's sick economy and its patchwork of regulations can keep cultivating the freewheeling ecosystem that startups need to thrive. Equity financing for European venture-backed companies reached [euro]7.9 billion ($8.9 billion), up from [euro]6.3 billion in 2013--the biggest amount invested since 2001, when companies secured [euro]10.6 billion, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. The number of venture-backed IPOs in the region in 2014 more than tripled to 55, which raised a total of [euro]3.7 billion. In 2013, 18 IPOs raised a total of [euro]500 million. Overall, industry watchers expect 2015 to be a banner year for technology M&A and stock flotations in Europe. Stephen Lowery, a partner at Frog Capital, a U.K. venture-capital firm, said the tech sector in Europe was still maturing. ""U.S. venture capitalists have been raising their ninth, 10th and 11th funds--that is 30, 40 years of experience. European VCs are raising their third and fourth rounds. It takes time. There is money in Europe, and the good companies are getting funded,"" he told the Journal. ""We're going to see a lot of M&A and strategic acquisitions, as well as IPO activity in the European tech sector in 2015,"" said Adam Kostyêçl, senior vice president of listing services, Europe, at NASDAQ OMX Group Inc. Mr. Kostyêçl said that sectors to look at for high growth in Europe are e-commerce, financial technology, streaming content, big data, cybersecurity and advertising-tech companies. European companies are attracting capital at an earlier stage, he said, especially from American VCs. ""There are many fantastic opportunities here in Europe, and U.S. VCs aren't waiting; they're coming here to access them earlier,"" Mr. Kostyêçl said. But there are challenges ahead, including the maze of 28 sets of local regulations among members of the European Union. Despite fitful recoveries from the depths of the European economic crisis, some European economies are dragging the rest of the region. The U.S. has introduced some innovative tools to help startups grow. The JOBS Act lowers the hurdles for companies to list on an exchange, for instance, allowing smaller companies to file for a possible listing confidentially, and avoid early scrutiny by investors. ""European regulators have the ambition to do the same thing as the JOBS Act, but they have to work across so many jurisdictions. Europe is suffering from this now,"" Mr. Kostyêçl said. Amid those opportunities and challenges, WSJD has identified 11 companies to watch this year, based on our reporters' research and reporting. We've avoided many of the bigger or better-known startups--including those companies that have already listed, been bought out or are heavily tipped to ""exit"" imminently. Instead, we've concentrated on a handful of firms still toiling in relative obscurity. We've asked industry experts to handicap their chances of an initial public offering, a buyout or a breakout year in terms of growth or fundraising. By its nature, our list isn't scientific. But we think it is a useful map of the EMEA tech startup landscape for 2015. This is who we're looking at in 2015. 1. KnCMiner : Founded in 2013 in Stockholm, KnCMiner makes money from selling bitcoin mining equipment or capacity . The more people mine bitcoin, the harder it is to generate. That means that people need ever faster and more powerful machines. KnCMiner'sfunding round last September raised $14 million , and the company is getting out of selling bitcoin mining machines entirely, instead leasing power to customers. Customers can come to its website and pay a fee to get a certain amount of computing power for a duration of time. KnCMiner has built a vast data center, which consumes 30 megawatts of power, in northern Sweden, in the Arctic Circle. The company is designing its own new processors and is looking to open more data centers. While the price of bitcoin continues to slide, investors are still bullish about KnCMiner, mostly because the company already has significant traction, bitcoin could rise again and KnCMiner could diversify its operations to other blockchain services down the line. Amir Mizroch 2. SiSense: SiSense, a business intelligence company from Tel Aviv, secured a $30 million investment in 2014. The company makes big-data analytics software intended to run on regular computers with no additional hardware. Some of its customers include Target, eBay Inc., ESPN, Samsung Electronics and Wix.com. Having grown from a 30 person operation in 2012 to nearly a 90-strong company with offices in New-York, it is now looking to expand again and intends to open new offices in the U.S. and Europe. Amir Mizroch 3. Kano : Riding on growing interest in coding , London-based startup Kano Computing Ltd. has shipped thousands of tool kits that allow users to build a computer and write software easily . While the company nominally aims at the children's market, it is also working with educational, corporate and government institutions. Pearson PLC, the world's largest education company, is using Kano to deliver a new computing curriculum in the U.K. New directions for the company could include adding games to the kits, more advanced coding and even new product classes. Amir Mizroch 4. Klarna: 2015 is the year that Swedish startup Klarna enters the U.S. online payments market. It is spending $100 million to square off against competitors like eBay's PayPal, Amazon.com Inc. and Stripe Inc. Klarna has been a success in Sweden, where it handles some 30% of all online payments. In time, it plans to add about 100 employees in the U.S. The company was valued at $1.4 billion in a funding deal last year with backing from outfits like Sequoia Capital. Klarna says the $300 million it has raised so far will be ample to cover its initial U.S. push, but may seek further funding as it ramps up its U.S. operations. Orr Hirschauge 5. Truecaller. Stockholm-based startup Truecaller, with its namesake caller-ID app, has raised around $60 million in funding and big name backers, including Skype founder Niklas Zennstrê_m's Atomico Ventures. Mr. Zennstrê_m has also joined Truecaller as a special adviser. At the beginning of December the app had more than 100 million users, having tripled its user base in three months. Growth in India made up a large part of this, with some 45 million Indian daily users. Orr Hirschauge 6. Fiverr: Israel-based online services marketplace Fiverr International last year raised a Series C round of $30 million from investors to expand into new locations and open sites in languages other than English. The company is in hypergrowth stage, meaning it plans on having a big growth year in 2015, including opening a new office in Chicago. Fiverr is tapping a highly connected, underemployed workforce. Services start at $5. Prices are higher based on factors including the complexity of the task, time delivered and quality. Fiverr takes 20% of every gig purchased. Amir Mizroch 7. SigFox : Mobile operators are counting on billions of connected objects--from road signs to your toaster--to justify their investments in new cellular networks. But French networking startup SigFox is rolling out a cheap, long-range radio technology that could upset those plans. Using license-free radio spectrum and simple radio chips similar to a garage-door opener, the Toulouse-based company says it can send low-bandwidth signals tens, if not hundreds, of miles--allowing it to cover countries with relatively few antennae. Revenue is still small, at [euro]6 million last year. But with clients in sectors spanning shipping, retail and security, and a foothold in 20 countries, investors are paying attention: The company is planning to raise [euro]100 million in coming weeks from venture capitalists and strategic investors, says co-founder and CEO Ludovic Le Moan. Sam Schechner 8. Nordeus: Nordeus, a gaming-design company from Serbia, has been the quiet hero on the European gaming scene, ceding the headlines to major players like King, Supercell and Rovio. But to many investors, Nordeus is one to watch. It is expanding its games portfolio into more categories. Its Top Eleven football manager sports game has been a consistent top 10 in the app stores and, while free to play, makes money through in-app purchases [the company doesn't disclose revenue]. The company itself is expanding, with offices in Serbia, Dublin and San Francisco. It is opening a games-development office in London soon. Most important, it is shifting to a mobile-first, cross-platform strategy to take on the giants like King and Supercell. Players are also incentivized to watch in-app video ads. Amir Mizroch 9. Oxbotica : Spun out of Oxford University's Mobile Robotics Group only three months ago, British startup Oxbotica may be one of the few companies in the world to rival Google in driverless cars. The company is working on robotics and autonomous systems, flexible-display technology with applications in ""smart"" glasses, synthetic retinas and foldable screens. Dr. Graeme Smith, Oxbotica CEO, says his company builds 3-D maps of cities with sensors and cameras through which autonomous systems can navigate their environment. Oxbotica is sitting on some 40 different intellectual property patents from Oxford University to which it has exclusive world-wide license, and it is trying to commercialize those patents. The company is currently talking to car manufacturers, surveying firms, logistics firms, warehouse companies, civil engineering and building firms, and even games companies. Amir Mizroch 10. Withings: Withings was among the first companies to connect personal health to the Internet, with its Wi-Fi-enabled bathroom scale six years ago. Since then, the boutique French tech firm has expanded its lineup of connected devices to include blood-pressure monitors, sleep-quality sensors, fitness trackers and a well-reviewed pair of smartwatches. But the pressure will be on this year as connected health moves from being a Silicon Valley buzzword to a battleground for the likes of Apple Inc., Google and Samsung Electronics Co. Withings doesn't disclose revenue figures, but says it has doubled its staff in the past year to 160, after raising [euro]23.5 million in 2013. Next up, according to co-founder and CEO Cê©dric Hutchings: raising ""significant funds to fully take advantage of this opportunity."" Sam Schechner 11. Wooga: Wooga has accomplished what few game developers have: serial success. While King Digital Entertainment and Rovio have created megahits such as ""Candy Crush Saga"" and ""Angry Birds,"" repeating that success has proved elusive. But for the Berlin-based company founded in 2009, there is a method to Wooga's roster of hits--five in total, including ""Diamond Dash,"" ""Pearl's Peril,"" and ""Jelly Splash""--according to CEO Jens Begemann. The company relies on a ""hit filter"" and decentralized teams of developers to find what works and what doesn't. Wooga's games are free to play and designed for smartphones and social media like Facebook, with profits being driven by in-app purchases. The company said revenue rose by 30%, and earnings before interest and taxes had quadrupled in 2014. Chase Gummer 12. Lumus : Based in Rehovot, some 12 miles south of Tel Aviv, this company's unassuming offices belie an advanced technology behind many of the wearable display prototypes on the market. The company's see-through head-mounted displays are a step ahead of the competition in resolution and sharpness. Hailing from Israel's defense industries, where similar technologies were used to create visor displays for fighter pilots, the company has an experienced engineering team. Some smart goggles with Lumus displays are intended to hit the enterprise market this year, and some consumer models made by top-tier consumer electronics companies are expected to be announced.

Doc_34,European 'Cash-Box' Firms Underperform Broader Commercial Market; Companies Use Proceeds from IPOs to Buy Real Estate,"Pirolo, Alessia; Neumann, Jeannette",None available.,"Europe's commercial-property markets turned in a strong performance in 2014, but one group of investors mostly missed the boat: those who bet on so-called cash-box or blank-check companies. Such companies collect money from investors via initial public offerings before they own any assets. The goal is to use the proceeds from the IPOs to buy real estate--ideally, in the case of European property, at low prices. Five European cash-box companies went public in 2014, raising a collective $5.1 billion, the highest since the financial crisis hit Europe, according to Dealogic. But the new shares underperformed more established public real-estate companies, and new offerings have dried up. The broad FTSE EPRA/Nareit Developed Europe Index of property companies saw a nearly 26% rise during the year, its best since 2012, as values of commercial property in many parts of the continent and U.K. rose. The five cash-box companies all underperformed the index. One of them--Lar Espaê±a Real Estate Socimi SA--was trading about 9% below its IPO price on Tuesday. During the year, one cash-box company that went public, Axia Real Estate Socimi SA of Spain, originally had a goal to raise [euro]400 million, or $473 million at current exchange rates. The company decided to keep the size of the offering to [euro]360 million so that there was more demand than supply and the stock would rise, according to Chony Martê_n Vicente-Mazariegos, Axia's chief financial officer. Shares, which began trading at [euro]10 each last summer, initially dropped but were at [euro]10.37 on Tuesday. Quabit Inmobiliaria SA, a Spanish investment company, withdrew its plans to launch a cash-box company that would have been the first real-estate investment trust to focus on Spanish residential properties. Green Street Advisors said the pipeline for cash-box IPOs is empty. ""It is pretty clear that the market has turned against cash boxes,"" said Jamie McDevitt, an analyst at Green Street. ""The 2014 returns have been shockingly bad compared to EPRA,"" the property-company index. As a rule, cash-box companies don't jump out of the gate like some technology IPOs do. But the new real-estate companies were slower to deploy their capital than investors expected. What's more, by the time they raised capital and started buying real estate, high demand for European property already had begun to drive up prices. The underperformance is a reminder of the risks of diving into untested real-estate investments--and the importance of timing, analysts say. Most cash-box companies are structured as REITs, a decades-old structure in the U.S. but one that is relatively new in countries such as Ireland and Spain. Governments tweaked their tax laws to make REITs possible in the hope that they would help attract capital to their countries' property markets. The volume of European commercial property purchased in 2014, including in the U.K., is expected to have been the highest since the financial crisis, according to Real Capital Analytics. While a final tally for the year isn't in, during the first three quarters of 2014 more than [euro]138.9 billion worth of real estate traded hands, up from [euro]122.6 billion in 2013. This increased demand has driven up prices and pushed down the yield on properties. Green Street Advisors said the projected returns of the properties it tracks dropped to 5.8% in 2014 from 6.6% at the end of 2013. Cash-box companies experienced this first hand. For example, a venture including Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate PLC--a U.K. cash-box company--last year paid [euro]311 million for a suburban Dublin office park, 25% more than what the property had been marketed for in fall 2013, according to Green Street. A spokesman for Kennedy Wilson, which went public in February, declined to comment. ""The appetite to give funds to cash-box investors to do with it what they want has diminished,"" said Juan Manuel de Remedios, a capital-markets partner with law firm White & Case LLP in Madrid. ""Yes, there are still opportunities, but the bargains have probably disappeared."" Likewise, Lar Espaê±a, which counts Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, as its largest investor, last March raised [euro]400 million with plans to buy Spanish shopping centers outside of major cities such as Madrid and Barcelona. The yield on its first acquisition--[euro]39.5 million for two shopping centers in the Spanish towns of Irun and Palencia--was 8.25%, according to CBRE Group Inc. But by July prices had risen. êÅnecblau, a shopping center southwest of Barcelona that Lar Espaê±a bought that month for [euro]80 million, had a yield of 6.5%, CBRE said. Lar Espaê±a Chairman Josê© Luis del Valle said the company seeks ""to create value through active management and the possibilities of appreciation offered by current valuation levels,"" and is confident ""that the return on these assets will be manifested at the end of 2015, early 2016."" Pimco didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Executives at Spanish REITs say the interest in new vehicles has cooled because investors are increasingly skeptical that a new cash-box company would be able to generate solid returns in an already crowded field. ""The assets that everyone wants to buy are already fully priced,"" said Ismael Clemente, executive chairman of Merlin Properties SA, a Spanish REIT that raised [euro]1.25 billion in July. Merlin, which was technically a cash box, went public with an already inked deal to purchase 880 bank branches from a Spanish lender. This year, he said, ""there could be IPOs of companies that already have assets, but the time of cash boxes is gone."" In the U.S., after the commercial-real-estate collapse of the early 1990s, initial public offerings of REITs played a critical role in attracting new capital to the market. But almost all IPOs back then were of companies with existing portfolios and long operating track records. Those types of companies--and not cash boxes--now have the best chance of going public in Europe as well. Due to disappointing performance, ""the market has been more selective,"" said Massimo Saletti, global co-head of real estate, gaming and lodging at Deutsche Bank AG. Indeed, Quabit Inmobiliaria, which postponed its plan to take public a cash-box REIT called Bulwin Investments, is assembling a portfolio before making its move in the public market, said Jorge Calvet, vice president of Quabit Inmobiliaria and chairman of Bulwin. ""We thought it was better not to pursue an IPO in a trying moment for the market,"" Mr. Calvet said.

Doc_35,Pages From USA Today to Appear in Other Papers; Gannett's Flagship Strikes Partnership With Nine Other Publications,"Alpert, Lukas I","Gannett Co. on Thursday will announce deals to insert content from USA Today, its flagship newspaper, into a range of small and midsize publications owned by other newspaper groups, an arrangement meant to help both sides boost circulation revenue and attract new advertisers.","Gannett Co. on Thursday will announce deals to insert content from USA Today, its flagship newspaper, into a range of small and midsize publications owned by other newspaper groups, an arrangement meant to help both sides boost circulation revenue and attract new advertisers. For Gannett, the new program is an expansion of what the company was already doing for over a year at 35 of the 82 newspapers it owns. It follows similar programs launched by the Washington Post and the New York Times last year offering supplements of their content to other newspapers. Gannett's nine new partners include Indiana-based Schurz Communications, whose 19 papers have a combined circulation of 245,000, as well as the Colorado Springs Gazette, the Record in Bergen County, N.J., and the Knoxville News Sentinel. The partnerships allow the smaller papers to give readers access to broader national, lifestyle and business news at low cost, while bringing USA Today audiences it might not otherwise reach. The two sides will share ad revenue. The program starts just ahead of a planned spinoff of Gannett's struggling publishing assets from its more lucrative broadcast unit. In the company's most recent earnings call , Gannett CEO Gracia Martore said details on the split would be revealed in March. Newspapers across the board are struggling to find innovative ways to grow as readers migrate to the Web and print ad revenue declines. Gannett is no exception: Ad revenue at its 82 U.S. newspapers fell 7.7% in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, with national ad revenue tumbling 20.8%. The company sees the inserts as a promising way to jump-start growth in ads and subscriptions. ""What we found with our papers was that [subscriber turnover] dropped in every market and [the inserts] increased the amount of money people would spend on a subscription,"" said Larry Kramer, USA Today's president and publisher. ""We were able to unlock value--many millions of dollars in fact--just inside the Gannett network."" He said it was a ""no-brainer"" to extend the idea to new partners. The inserts have helped USA Today boost its circulation figures, thanks to rule changes at the Alliance for Audited Media, which tracks newspaper metrics. Inserts accounted for a large part of the paper's jump to 4.1 million in October from 2.9 million the year before. USA Today is the largest newspaper in the country, ahead of The Wall Street Journal (2.3 million) and the New York Times (2.1 million). Mr. Kramer said the program helped USA Today make deeper inroads with national advertisers by allowing them to reach a much wider swath of readers with a single ad buy rather than having to negotiate deals with dozens of publications. ""For example, we now have a lot of readers in truck country, so we have been able to sell a lot of ads targeting that audience,"" he said. After seeing the impact the supplements had with Gannett papers, Schurz Communications officials approached USA Today about extending the deal. ""We think the big gains could be in reducing churn and in the cost of customer acquisition by offering a more complete package,"" said Kerry Oslund, Schurz's senior vice president of publishing and emerging media. ""We expect there to be some national ad revenue as well and the upside is that there is almost no expense, so we think we can find a margin here."" Late last year, both the Washington Post and the New York Times began offering Sunday print supplements to other U.S. newspapers. The Times, for example, launched with the Dallas Morning News, whose subscribers can pay an additional $1.99 for Times content once a week. The Post's offering of national news now appears in three newspapers for subscribers who pay an additional 99 cents. The print supplement is an extension of a digital partnership the Post has with 250 newspapers granting their readers free access to the Post's website, which is available only to subscribers. The extra traffic has helped the Post's Web traffic increase 71% in the past year to 42.6 million unique views in December, according to analytics firm comScore Inc. Some similar offerings in the past haven't generated huge returns. This year, The Wall Street Journal pulled the plug on a 15-year-old Sunday supplement made up of exclusive content that appeared in 67 papers. While the program delivered a small profit, the Journal wanted to refocus on projects that had greater potential for growth, according to a person familiar with the situation. Media analysts, however, say the programs can help struggling newspapers. ""These pages help build value for readers, and they help create a national advertising footprint,"" said Jim Friedlich, head of Empirical Media, a consultancy that advises media companies on digital strategies. ""So this is potentially a win-win for everyone involved."" Write to Lukas I. Alpert at lukas.alpert@wsj.com Credit: By Lukas I.

Doc_36,"As Gasoline Heads Toward $2, the Benefits Start to Trickle Down; Consumers Step Up Spending and Debt Reduction, but Oil Patch Faces a Big Pinch","Timiraos, Nick","Gas prices are below $2 a gallon in 27 states. Since 1980, gas prices have only once seen a bigger six-month decline.","Gas prices appear headed below a nationwide average of $2 a gallon in coming days, one of the swiftest declines on record and one that is beginning to ripple through the U.S. economy in ways both familiar and unpredictable. Restaurants and bars are seeing their best sales growth in years. Americans are driving more--and buying bigger cars and trucks. Consumer confidence is sitting at an 11-year high, with lower-income households showing the biggest improvement. And some households are using the savings at the pump to get caught up on debts. But the drop in oil prices is also testing the nation's booming energy sector, spurring layoffs and cutbacks. The speed of the decline, which partly reflects a deteriorating outlook for global demand, has unsettled Wall Street, putting stock and bond investors--already uneasy over sluggish global growth--on the lookout for clues that the U.S. might be hurt more than previously thought. Still, for the nation as a whole, economists generally say the benefits of cheaper gas will outweigh those costs. ""To the extent you're seeing weakness, it's very concentrated and somewhat dramatic,"" said Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon. ""It's more evident than the additional spending power that any one family is going to have, which will be spread fairly thinly,"" even though in the aggregate, ""it will end up being a significant positive."" Average pump prices--$2.04 a gallon Thursday--are now down more than 40% since last June, when they stood near $3.68 a gallon, according to the auto club AAA. Gas prices are below $2 a gallon in 27 states. Since 1980, gas prices have only once seen a bigger six-month decline. That came during the 2008 financial crisis and was driven almost wholly by a collapse in demand, while the current slowdown has stemmed from both higher supply and weaker global demand. The drop in gas prices comes amid an economic expansion that has shown signs of acceleration. Job growth last year ran at its best pace in 15 years, and the economy during the third quarter expanded at a 5% seasonally adjusted annual rate, its strongest pace in 11 years. ""Lower gasoline prices should provide some relief in the near term for many households who live paycheck to paycheck,"" particularly against a backdrop of weak wage growth and rising housing and health insurance costs, Howard Levine, chief executive of Family Dollar Stores Inc., said recently. Mr. Levine told analysts this month that while Family Dollar's typical shopper is ""still struggling,"" customer traffic at the discount retailer notched its strongest growth in two years last month, punctuated by its highest ever sales for a single day on Christmas Eve. Falling gas prices benefit lower- and middle-income households more than top earners because energy costs account for a higher share of their income. The bottom fifth of earners spent around 12% of their after-tax income on gas last year, compared with around 3% for the top fifth of earners, according to Wells Fargo. If prices remain at current levels, the lowest-income households will spend around 8.3% of their income on gas this year, compared with around 2% for the highest-income households. ""Most restaurants depend on what's happening with the middle class, and with gas prices down so much, we are seeing across-the-board increases"" in sales, said David Barr, chairman of Your Pie, a fast-casual pizza chain with stores in four southern states. ""Anything in quick-service dining is seeing quite a bit of the benefit,"" said Mr. Barr, who also owns 23 KFC chicken franchises. To be sure, lower oil prices have a thorny underside for Texas, North Dakota and other regions where higher energy prices unleashed a boom in drilling, thanks to advanced extraction techniques from shale-oil formations. Field-service companies are cutting jobs and drill-rig counts are falling. ""This is what I hate about this industry, frankly, is these brutal cycles we have to go through,"" said Martin Craighead, chief executive of oil-field services company Baker Hughes Inc., in an earnings call on Tuesday. The company said it was cutting 7,000 jobs world-wide, or 12% of its workforce. High-yield bond issuance from energy companies, meanwhile, has jumped to $189 billion outstanding, from $89 billion in 2010, according to Wells Fargo. The energy sector accounts for around 14% of outstanding corporate bonds, and rising defaults could lead to greater financial volatility and increased borrowing costs for some companies. One question now is whether, following the deep recession of 2007-09, more Americans will use any windfall at the pump to reduce debt, shore up savings or spend more on discretionary items. For Wendy Zona of Johnson City, Tenn., the lower prices have been ""a great benefit for my family--one we definitely weren't counting on."" Her husband, a restaurant manager, drives his Ford Escape an hour each way to work and spends around $75 on gas every week, down from around $140 last summer. She isn't making big plans, however, for the savings. Ms. Zona, 44 years old, who has an office job at a car dealership, says most of it will cover medical expenses from her gallbladder surgery that required a long hospital stay late last year. She also has a son in college. ""We've got lots of other bills to dig out from under,"" she said. If crude-oil prices remain at $50 a barrel, it would result in per capita savings of roughly $575--or nearly $1,325 per U.S. household--on gas over the coming year relative to last year's spending, according to an estimate prepared for The Wall Street Journal by ClearView Energy Partners. That is up from its most recently published estimate of $380 made at the beginning of December, when oil prices stood near $75 a barrel. The larger figure doesn't include an average $100 in savings relative to 2013 spending that consumers booked from cheaper gas last year. Through last week, pump prices have declined for 16 straight weeks, breaking the record set in 2008, according to the Energy Information Administration, whose records date to 1990. The EIA said prices on Monday averaged $2.07 a gallon. Prices last fell below $2 in November 2008 and remained below that mark for around six months. Adjusted for inflation, gas prices fell below $2 a gallon in 1986 and remained below that level for the better part of the next 17 years. If history is any guide, consumers will spend around 25% of any gas savings within six months, and around two-thirds within one year, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. Some of the increased savings are beginning to show up in gauges of economic performance and consumer sentiment. Data from the Federal Reserve showed that credit-card balances declined in November at their fastest pace in a year. The nation's personal saving rate fell for the fifth straight month to its lowest level all year, at 4.4%, according to separate data from the Commerce Department. When gas prices fell by a similar magnitude in 1986, the saving rate fell from 9.3% in March to 6.4% by year end. Retail sales in December excluding gasoline rose 5.1% from a year earlier on a seasonally adjusted basis, compared to a 4.1% gain in 2013. Sales at restaurants and bars rose 8% from a year earlier, the best growth rate in seven years. Vehicle miles driven in the year ended November rose to a six-year high, the Federal Highway Administration said Tuesday, though they are still 1.3% below their 2007 peak. And sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles, up 10% over the past year, are increasing faster than sales of passenger cars, which are up 2%, according to researcher Autodata Corp.

It was the lowest closing price for the precious metal since Jan. 2. Investors are awaiting Friday's U.S. nonfarm payroll data, which many believe offers the clearest snapshot of how the economy is doing. Strong growth in jobs would bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, a move that may weigh on gold, which struggles to compete with yield-bearing investments when interest rates rise.

[...]though, Google has largely beaten back regulatory reviews of its business practices; in 2014, attorneys general in Texas and Ohio closed investigations.","Google Inc. escaped a U.S. antitrust investigation nearly unscathed in 2013, but the company isn't out of the regulatory woods. Disclosures that some staffers at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had recommended charging Google with violating antitrust laws are adding fuel to a long-running European probe into the same practices. U.S. rivals continue to complain to regulators about some of Google's search and advertising practices. Meanwhile, Google may face a new antitrust fight, as regulators probe how Google manages its Android mobile-operating system. An FTC staff report in 2012 detailed several ways in which Google appeared to have altered search results to favor its own services, although staffers in the agency's bureau of competition didn't recommend filing suit over those issues, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. The commission concluded its investigation in early 2013 without taking action. Google executives have long argued that their responsibility is to provide relevant search results, not promote websites, and if users don't like those results there are other search engines ""just a click away."" Following the FTC's decision, Google's rivals turned their attention to Europe, where officials have been investigating similar complaints against Google for five years and have rejected three Google settlement proposals. European Commission antitrust officials are expected to file formal charges against Google about its search practices, perhaps as soon as next month. Regulators in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Taiwan and India also are investigating Google's business practices, according to the company's annual financial filing. Until now, though, Google has largely beaten back regulatory reviews of its business practices; in 2014, attorneys general in Texas and Ohio closed investigations. One EU lawmaker said Friday that commission officials should consider the newly revealed evidence from the U.S. case in weighing charges against Google. ""This new... evidence is crucial and could not come at better time,"" said Ramon Tremosa I Balcells, a lawmaker who represents the Spanish region of Catalonia. Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt on Friday declined to comment on the European investigation or the potential impact of the U.S. disclosures. ""At end of the day, the FTC commission made their decision and we agree with that,"" Mr. Schmidt said in an interview. Google rivals haven't let up on the search issue. Local-services guide Yelp Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have been particularly active behind the scenes, trying to coordinate opposition to the search giant. Yelp last year launched a website, FocusOnTheUser.eu, that charges Google with favoring its own services in search results and asks website visitors to contact European legislators. The company may be preparing to air similar objections in the U.S. A Yelp executive has registered the "".com"" version of the same website, where today a message says the website is ""coming soon."" But some observers think the complaints are misplaced. Danny Sullivan, the founding editor of Search Engine Land and a close Google watcher, says criticizing Google for favoring its own services is ""a waste of time, like complaining that one TV network doesn't favor another TV network's show enough."" Beyond search, other complaints loom about Google's business practices. In Europe, antitrust regulators have begun an inquiry into whether Google improperly requires the makers of devices that use its Android mobile-operating system to use certain Google services. Google makes Android available free to makers of smartphones and tablets as a way to deliver services like search and YouTube, which generate advertising revenue, and the Play Store, where Google makes money selling apps and games. Google rivals including Microsoft and Oracle Corp. last year filed a formal complaint with the European Commission, claiming that makers of Android devices that want popular Google apps, including Maps, are required to preload a suite of Google mobile services and give them prominent placement. The Wall Street Journal first reported secret contracts that Google had drawn up laying out those requirements. Android powers 65% of smartphones in Western Europe, according to Strategy Analytics, slightly lower than its global market share. U.S. regulators are not known to have looked closely at Android. Mr. Sullivan, while skeptical of the antitrust claims around search, says Google ""deserves attention"" from antitrust regulators on its Android dealings. ""I think that's much harder to defend,"" he says. Google has another victory to point to. A Google spokesman said on Friday that the company was informed last year by the FTC that the Commission had closed an investigation, first reported in 2013, into its display advertising practices.

It is a strong signal that Google's ambitions extend beyond selling advertising and services over the Internet to influencing how Internet access is delivered.","Google Inc. said it plans to launch a U.S. wireless service, raising a new risk of tension between the Internet company and the wireless carriers that support its Android mobile-operating system. The service would be small-scale and not intended to compete with the four big U.S. national carriers, Sundar Pichai, the Google executive who oversees Android, told an industry conference in Barcelona. Instead, it would be intended to demonstrate technical innovations that carriers could adopt. However small Google's entry, the move by the creative and well-capitalized technology company is likely to send ripples through a business long controlled by Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc., Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. It is a strong signal that Google's ambitions extend beyond selling advertising and services over the Internet to influencing how Internet access is delivered. ""You will see us announce it in the coming months,"" Mr. Pichai said. ""Our goal here is to drive a set of innovations which we think the system should adopt."" The comments confirmed earlier media reports of the company's plans. Google has struck deals with Sprint and T-Mobile to resell service on their networks, people familiar with the matter have said. Mr. Pichai said on Monday that Google would team up with carriers to launch the service but didn't name them. AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile declined to comment. ""This raises another tension point in the new complex friend-and-foe relationship between Google and operators,"" said Rajeev Chand, head of research at Rutberg & Company, an investment bank focused on the mobile industry. ""You have to wonder what the market-wide impact will be."" Google's planned service would sift through cellular connections from Sprint and T-Mobile and Wi-Fi ""hot spots,"" picking the best signal for routing calls, texts and data, these people have said. Mr. Pichai said the service aims for seamless handoffs between Wi-Fi and cell networks to prevent dropped calls and automatically re-connect them. Google says it is focused on improving the quality of wireless connections. But tapping Wi-Fi networks could reduce the amount of data users transfer across cellular networks, undermining a growing source of income for wireless carriers. ""If Google focuses heavily on cheaper data usage, that would have downward impact on pricing for mobile operators,"" said Neil Mawston, an mobile-industry analyst at Strategy Analytics. ""This may go two ways: Lower priced data may encourage much higher data usage, which would be relatively positive for carriers, or Google may drive down data prices so quickly and it could chip away at mobile operators' profits."" Mr. Mawston said Google has a history of lowering prices in areas such as maps, email and Android itself, which is free for handset makers. It also challenged telecom-industry giants with its high-speed fiber-optic Internet service in a few cities. AT&T responded with a higher speed service of its own. Google's move into cellular comes amid an industry squeeze, as T-Mobile and Sprint lower prices to boost subscriber counts, while the cost to acquire wireless spectrum rises. The tech firm has to move cautiously, however, because it depends on carriers to help promote phones powered by its Android software. More Android users mean more people using Google's search, maps and other services. Android had 53% of the U.S. smartphone market in the last three months of 2014, compared with nearly 42% for Apple Inc., according to data from comScore. Google has talked to carriers about its plans, Mr. Pichai said. He said its approach would be like the one Google adopted with its Nexus phones, which the company uses to demonstrate its vision for how Android should operate, even as the vast majority of Android phones are sold by other manufacturers. ""They know what we are doing,"" he said. ""Partners like Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint in the U.S. are what powers most of our Android phones. And the model works extremely well for us.

[...]recently, Kaisa appeared to be in good financial shape, but the Shenzhen government has blocked approvals of some of its developments and property sales in the city. Kaisa said Monday that it is looking to appoint a financial adviser to help with its troubles, and that HSBC Holdings PLC had granted it a waiver on a $51.6 million loan, meaning Kaisa doesn't have to repay the money for now.","HONG KONG--A law firm says it has brought together a group of Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd.'s offshore bondholders to help protect their investments after the Chinese property firm failed to make an interest payment. The move comes as onshore creditors are also seeking to freeze assets of Kaisa. The company said late Monday it hadn't made a scheduled interest payment of $23 million on an offshore bond, when companies on the mainland go bust. Kirkland & Ellis LLP has gathered investors holding more than 30% of one of Kaisa's bonds, and is currently organizing holders of five other bonds to reach the threshold required for legal action, according to a person familiar with the situation. Big global funds and distressed-asset management firms are in the group, the person said. Investors holding 25% of the outstanding amount of each issue can take enforcement action against the company, according to Kaisa's bond prospectus. Any return negotiated by holders of one issue would apply to the other issues as well. The investor group isn't taking action yet.

More than two dozen foreign fund companies, ranging from BlackRock Inc. to Fidelity Investments and Lion Global Investors, owned Kaisa debt in recent months, according to Thomson Reuters, although it isn't clear how many currently hold the debt. BlackRock and Fidelity have declined to comment, while a spokesperson for Lion Global, a Singapore-based fund company, said it has sold its holdings. It is unclear whether these funds are involved in the investor group. The company is the biggest casualty so far among property companies in China as economic growth slows and the housing market weakens. Until recently, Kaisa appeared to be in good financial shape, but the Shenzhen government has blocked approvals of some of its developments and property sales in the city. Neither the company not the government have provided an explanation. Several executives have left the company, including Kaisa's founder and longtime chairman, Kwok Ying Shing. Kaisa said Monday that it is looking to appoint a financial adviser to help with its troubles, and that HSBC Holdings PLC had granted it a waiver on a $51.6 million loan, meaning Kaisa doesn't have to repay the money for now. Earlier, Kaisa said it had defaulted on the HSBC loan. Investors welcomed Kaisa's statement. The prices of Kaisa's offshore bonds prices rebounded on Tuesday to 44-49 cents to the dollar, after tumbling 80% over the past month to around 30 cents. The company has shortlisted two banks as financial advisers--Jefferies and Houlihan Lokey, two people familiar with the situation said. Kaisa said on Monday it will make a decision shortly; efforts to reach the company Tuesday were unsuccessful. ""The appointment of a financial adviser is important given that many [creditors] have taken action and many of the company's projects are now affected,"" said Charles Macgregor, Asia head at Lucror Analytics, a credit-research firm. Still, questions remain unanswered on whether or when the sales and development of Kaisa's projects in Shenzhen will be unlocked and how the company will handle demands from onshore creditors. Kaisa said Monday it has received notices from its onshore creditors demanding immediate repayment of amounts owed to them. Several bank accounts of the group have been frozen, with a total balance of 713 million yuan ($115 million), the company said. At least 17 financial firms, including banks, four trust firms, and a wealth management company, have asked a court in Shenzhen to freeze Kaisa's assets. ""It is a rush to cash out. The first creditor makes a move and others will follow so that they won't lose out if there is any settlement negotiation,"" said Alex Wang, Shanghai managing partner at Dentons, a global law firm. ""It is a pretty ugly situation."" It is also especially worrying for overseas investors, who get paid long after domestic investors and have no direct access to assets on the mainland because of capital restrictions. ""We don't like to see onshore creditors take self-help actions to freeze assets in China as that will destroy the value of the company's assets,"" said Mr. McDonald, who represents creditors offshore. ""If they push too far, it might force the company to seek some form of bankruptcy protection and lead to an onshore liquidation. That wouldn't be in anyone's interest."" He also said if Kaisa isn't acting to protect all creditors' interests, it will lead the group of foreign bondholders to try to take control of Kaisa's offshore subsidiaries and reach out to its onshore assets. ""We would only do this as a last resort and we really hope that this won't be necessary,"" he said. The best scenario is for the group to work with Kaisa and try to come up with a ""consensual solution"" that benefits all stakeholders, including both onshore and offshore creditors, he said.

The company said it sold 61.1 million units last year, up from 18.7 million in 2013. Lei Jun, Xiaomi's founder and chief executive, said in a post on his verified Chinese microblog account that 2014 sales, including taxes, more than doubled from a year earlier to 74.3 billion yuan (US$11.97 billion). In the third quarter, Xiaomi among global smartphone sellers, with a market share of 5.6%, up from 2.1%, according to data provider Strategy Analytics. But industry leaders Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. remain far ahead. In the first three quarters of 2014, Samsung sold 241.5 million smartphones, according to IDC. And in its latest fiscal year, Apple sold 169.2 million smartphones. ""In 2015, the smart devices playing field will become extremely competitive, especially as the growth of the smartphone industry in mainland China slows down,"" Mr. Lei said. He also said the company would be launching its next flagship device later this month. Mr. Lei said competitors in the industry were seeking to imitate Xiaomi's business model. He didn't specify how they were doing so. Several Chinese smartphone makers have in the past year or so adopted Xiaomi's strategy of selling more phones over the Internet instead of joining with mobile phone carriers or selling through traditional retail channels, which is more expensive. Last month, the Chinese smartphone maker closed a funding round that raised $1.1 billion, giving it a , including the fresh capital. Mr. Lei said Xiaomi sold more than a million smartphones in India in five months. The company's performance in India came despite a by the High Court of Delhi on the sale and import of Xiaomi handsets in the country. The court ordered the temporary injunction as it waited to hear a patent complaint by Swedish telecommunications-equipment maker Ericsson, which alleged that the Chinese company was using its technology without paying royalties. Later, the Indian court gave temporary permission to resume the import of Xiaomi devices. Mr. Lei also said Xiaomi would enter more overseas markets this year, but didn't go into specifics. It has expanded in recent years to seven other countries and regions outside the mainland, including Taiwan, Southeast Asia and India. The company comprises a web of offshore and Chinese entities. At the top of its corporate structure is Xiaomi Corp., a Cayman Islands-incorporated entity. Xiaomi H.K. Ltd., an offshore entity that is wholly owned by Xiaomi Corp., recorded a net profit of 3.46 billion yuan ($566 million) last year, according to a confidential document viewed by The Wall Street Journal in November. Xiaomi, founded by Mr. Lei in 2010, has grown rapidly to become the top-selling smartphone vendor in China by offering affordable phones with features that rival high-end models. Xiaomi phones come with a customized version of Google Inc.'s Android operating system and the company often updates software based on user requests. Xiaomi's current valuation puts it above all other startups currently backed by venture capitalists, including Uber Technologies Inc., the taxi-booking app that earlier this month said . Only Facebook Inc. in 2011 raised capital at a higher valuation from private investors--an investment from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. valued the social network at $50 billion.

The current roster of Antuit clients include Hyatt Hotels Corp. and Avon Products Inc. and Antuit operates offices from New York to Bangalore.,"HONG KONG--Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is placing a bet on big data's growth in Asia. The U.S. investment bank is leading a $56 million investment in Singapore's Antuit Holdings Pte. Ltd. to help it grow and acquire rivals in Asia's rapidly growing data analytics market, according to a person familiar with the situation. Zodius Capital, an existing investor in Antuit, is also participating in the latest fundraising, the person said. The global market for big data is expanding rapidly as companies like Antuit to try to turn data from social media and mobile phone applications into sales traffic and new customers. Big data analytics requires complex software that evaluates a web of interconnected pieces of information from a multitude of sources to create a profile of a customer or solve a business problem. The market is lucrative and still in its early growth. Silicon Valley big data analytics firm Palantir Technologies, which sells big data software to the U.S. government and Wall Street, raised a round of funding last week that valued it at $15 billion, making it the third most valuable company backed by venture capitalists in the world after Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. and Uber Technologies, Inc. Antuit and its backers are hoping they can seize a piece of the market by building a foothold in Asia. Goldman's funding should help them snatch up smaller competitors and engineering talent before U.S. rivals are able to expand their reach into the region. As part of the deal, Goldman's Asia co-head of private equity, Ankur Sahu, will join the company's board of directors. Antuit's niche in the big data market is its ability to link large global clients with inexpensive engineers and data analysts in Asia, particularly India. As a Singapore-based company with operations in India, the company's management wants to replicate the success of Asian business process outsourcing companies in servicing multinational clients by tapping talent in India. Antuit Chairman and Zodius Capital Chief Executive Neeraj Bhargava was a co-founder of business process outsourcing company WNS (Holdings) Ltd. The current roster of Antuit clients include Hyatt Hotels Corp. and Avon Products Inc. and Antuit operates offices from New York to Bangalore. Antuit is still a young firm. Zodius Capital helped Antuit get off the ground in 2013 when it funded the $3 million purchase of New York-based analytics firm Marketwell.

Along with the details Apple has already released about how the watch will work, it's convinced me Apple Watch will be a launching pad for the next wave of billion-dollar consumer-tech startups. Contrast that with the predictions of many pundits that the watch will flop, or sell only modestly. Others, like the analysts behind a Morgan Stanley note from November, are so optimistic they project the watch will sell 30 million units in its first year, increasing Apple's value by more than 10% and adding more than $50 billion to its market cap. Apple has already revealed the sleek, customizable watch itself, and this being Apple, it's safe to assume the company is going to release hardware that's best in class. Much more important to the success or failure of the watch, however, are the apps. And Apple already has the world's deepest bench of happy, well-paid mobile-app developers, who collectively generated $10 billion in revenue at the App Store in 2014, according to Apple. So it should be no surprise that hundreds of companies, including giants like Facebook and Twitter, are racing to have watch apps ready from the first day of launch. This is only possible because in November Apple gave developers advance access to the so-called software development kit used to create apps for Apple Watch. Imagine walking into a grocery store with a shopping list on your watch, which knows your location so precisely that it can plot a route through the store, saving you the frustration of wandering from aisle to aisle, wondering where that one particular item is. Or imagine having all of Wikipedia in an app, one that unobtrusively alerts you to points of interest as you walk around a city. Both of these are examples of technology that's already possible on your phone. But what matters for adoption of a technology isn't what's possible for the user--what matters is what's easy. To use a historical analogy, the shift to mobile is one reason messaging supplanted email. Email was a product of a particular set of behaviors, including sitting down at a computer at a designated time and putting a certain amount of thought into responses. BlackBerry turned email into something like messaging, and touch-screen smartphones made it apparent that email was itself an anachronism, merely one conduit among many for what has become real-time communication. Consider the same sequence of events for contextual information--that is, alerts delivered at a particular time and place, such as reminders. Our phones buzz, we pull them out of our pockets or purses, read a push alert, swipe to unlock, wait a split second for an app to load, then perform an action that might have been designed with more free time and attention in mind than we have at that moment, if we're on the go or preoccupied. All that friction is one reason, I suspect, why location-based social networks like Foursquare never took off. But, like Google's Android Wear software, Apple Watch compresses all of those actions into what Apple calls a ""short look."" The watch vibrates, and when we look at it a single short message is visible. Apple goes even further than Android Wear by providing a ""long look"" that is activated when the watch detects that we're looking at it for more than a moment. The long look can display content, including photos and text, plus buttons allowing us to take further action. Separately, simply tapping the screen can bring up any other card or state-of-the-watch app, taking us deep into its contents. In this way, contextually appropriate information can be available on our wrist in an instant, and its depth can scale with the wearer's attention, from a session lasting a second through one lasting many minutes, as we scroll through the contents of a card within a watch app. Thus, wearables have the potential to make the entire push-notification-based interaction model truly convenient, increasing both the number of contexts in which we'll want to receive push notifications and the rate at which we can consume them. The result, based on what I've seen, is technology that allows you to both communicate with and consume not merely the Web, but physical space. Long the dream of computer scientists, this ""augmented reality"" is what Google was aiming for when it conceived its ill-fated Google Glass project. Abetting this change in behavior is a new technology called iBeacon, which allows an Apple Watch in an appropriately equipped building to triangulate its location to within centimeters. InMarket, which was first to market in getting Apple's iBeacon technology into stores, already reaches 32 million monthly active users, according to comScore. Its initial application in stores is pretty tame--imagine rewards programs and the digital equivalent of in-store circulars--but inMarket also has store-mapping technology of the sort I described above, says Chief Executive and founder Todd Dipaola. Already, can show retailers precisely where in a store you went. Connecting that to what they know about what you bought gives retailers something like the real-world version of the Web analytics Amazon uses to sell us more stuff. Meanwhile at Esri, a mapping-software company, developer Amber Case is thinking about an interface for Wikipedia driven by your location, as well as a new product that would be a ""Twitter for location-based data."" While many have highlighted Apple Watch's payments software and health-monitoring capabilities, its ability to connect us to what our phones already know about where we are and what we're doing--augmenting our reality with a new layer of data--makes me think it could bring about profound behavioral change in its users. As Apple illustrated with the iPhone, it's changes in what we find it easy and enjoyable to do that beget changes in our habits and social norms. And those are the shifts that create real opportunities for the next billion-dollar startup.

Doc_44,Professional Hockey Has Become a Gentleman's Game; Power-play opportunities have reached their lowest level since at least the 1968-69 season,"Baker, Dillon",[...]the 2013-14 season saw the implementation of hybrid icing--which allows referees to stop play if they determine that a certain player will win the race to the puck--leading to a decline in boarding penalties.,"If only Lady Byng could see an NHL game today, she would be so proud. In 1925, the wife of Canada's Governor-General donated a trophy to the league to promote sportsmanship and gentlemanly play. It has been given out to the player who most exemplifies these qualities every year since--even in hockey's most bloody, punch-drunk eras. This season, though, practically everyone in the league is a candidate. Power-play opportunities have reached their lowest level since at least the 1968-69 season, according to Stats LLC. The 6.27 average opportunities per game are a far cry from the high of 11.7 in the post-lockout 2005-06 season, which saw major rule changes meant to increase scoring and generally improve the game. Much of the decline can be attributed to fewer players going to the box for the game's more violent infractions. Charging, boarding, roughing and cross-checking are being called at the lowest rates since 2001-02, according to Stats. It seems that the NHL's plan to crack down on violent penalties this season is working. The league reclassified many of the penalties from the ""general"" category into the ""physical fouls"" category, which means that players who commit two of the fouls in one game would automatically incur a one-game suspension. On-ice rule changes also have contributed to the decline. For example, the 2013-14 season saw the implementation of hybrid icing--which allows referees to stop play if they determine that a certain player will win the race to the puck--leading to a decline in boarding penalties. The decline in penalties may also signal a shift in strategy and team-building. As advanced analytics gain popularity in front offices throughout the league, teams have begun dropping the so-called ""pest"" and ""enforcer"" players--the kind that normally draw penalties--in the name of greater puck possession.

For customers including Qualcomm Inc., Boeing Co. and Symantec Corp., Volometrix's software is a sort of real-time management consultant in a box. [...]people analytics is about lending credibility to one of the most vital and yet overlooked functions of a company--getting the most out of the unruly hominids who make it run.","Imagine a top corporate executive of the future. Instead of finding out what's going on in her company by asking her subordinates, she consults a digital dashboard that tells her everything from who is at their desk to how happy they are about it. Any measurement that falls outside historic norms or deviates from industry standards is flagged in red. Within minutes our manager knows what issues to focus on today--or this quarter--whether it's employee engagement or the size of her sales staff's social networks. This might sound far-fetched, but it isn't far removed from the services offered by a growing number of companies. What the services have in common is a willingness to use data to drive decision making in an area that has traditionally been an analytical backwater: human resources. The result is something academics have dubbed ""people analytics,"" and it treats the humans in an organization just like any other asset in the supply chain: as something that can be monitored, analyzed and reconfigured. Humans, it turns out, are remarkably predictable. ""Most companies have different flavors of the same basic problems,"" says Ryan Fuller, co-founder of Volometrix. Almost all HR software includes analytics, but Volometrix is unusual in its appetite for acquiring data. The company's software ingests every email and calendar item of every employee in a company, and uses that data to build a picture of who is doing what, and with whom. Many managers believe salespeople with more contacts outside a company are more successful. But, data reveals their success is also highly dependent on the size of their networks within the company. And the true size of those networks is easy to determine by analyzing who employees email and with whom they meet. Volometrix automatically does what a manager might do, such as emailing individual salespeople to encourage them to increase the size of their networks. (The company says it renders the data it collects on things like email anonymous to protect employee privacy.) For customers including Qualcomm Inc., Boeing Co. and Symantec Corp., Volometrix's software is a sort of real-time management consultant in a box. Rather than waiting for something to break and then calling a professional-services firm, managers can intervene on a continuous basis, says Mr. Fuller. Another approach to people analytics starts from the premise that happy workers are productive workers. CultureAmp, which is used by just about every tech startup you can name, including Box, Uber Technologies and Airbnb, allows managers to regularly take the temperature of their workforce through short surveys. The goal, says company founder Didier Elzinga, is to turn managers into ""people geeks,"" who are obsessed with quantifying otherwise nebulous concept of corporate culture. Kim Rohrer, who runs HR and people analytics at Disqus, an online-community startup with just 65 employees, says tools like CultureAmp have allowed her to accomplish what previously required an entire team of in-house people analysts at a company like Google, which in many ways pioneered people analytics. Ms. Rohrer organizes regular meetups in San Francisco for other heads of ""people ops,"" the de rigueur term for this new, more data-oriented kind of HR. And she says she has witnessed a rapid democratization of the tools and methods of people analytics. In a way, people analytics is about lending credibility to one of the most vital and yet overlooked functions of a company--getting the most out of the unruly hominids who make it run. In a modern corporation, data is a kind of currency. The more of it you have, the more power and influence you wield. Measuring and acting on things once viewed as ""warm and fuzzy,"" like whether employees feel recognized for their work, has had a quantifiable impact on retention and productivity at Disqus, says Ms. Rohrer. That's one reason Mr. Fuller of Volometrix thinks companies will soon be creating stand-alone people-analytics divisions that function at the intersection of sales, information technology and HR. ""More and more we see companies who are hiring for a [vice president] or director of people analytics,"" says Mr. Fuller. The idea that an organization can be made more effective by quantifying the moods and actions of its human constituents is likely to be intoxicating for managers who are accustomed to optimizing supply chains and IT infrastructure. But there are pitfalls in all this measurement. If the management's goal becomes optimizing certain performance metrics, whatever isn't measured can fall by the wayside. And yet, owing to a tight tech labor market, many of the companies most likely to espouse people analytics are also the ones that put the most value on things like culture that can't be quantified. Making employees more efficient, even happier, isn't the same thing as making them more creative or innovative. The experiments companies do in encouraging people to expand their in-house networks are repeatable and their results verifiable. But what about the experiments that really matter--which companies succeed or fail? For now at least, this most important test of the value of people analytics has yet to be examined with anything like the rigor the discipline demands.

Since acquiring the site early last year for $584.2 million, CoStar has spent about $80 million to update the technology and expand its scope, deploying thousands of researchers to visit and photograph 400,000 rental properties. It even charters airplanes to circle cities in search of leads on new construction. The site was quietly relaunched last week. Next month, CoStar will unveil a $100 million marketing campaign featuring actor Jeff Goldblum as an eccentric Silicon Valley executive touting the new Apartments.com as a ""game-changer."" Including the acquisition, CoStar expects the total investment in the site to top $1 billion over the next few years. Andrew Florance, CoStar founder and chief executive officer, says the spending is needed to create a new-generation Internet listing service. Most current listings services migrated from print publications, he said, and provide mainly static data that can be quickly out of date. ""Renters want to know what's actually available and what the price is,"" he said. ""And we're engineering from that perspective."" The move by CoStar comes as the share of Americans who rent rather than own is on the rise nationwide. A report released this month by New York University's Furman Center and Capital One Financial Corp. found that renters made up the majority of the city population in nine of the nation's 11 largest metropolitan areas in 2013. In 2006, when renters were the majority in only five of those cities. At the same time, landlords are spending more to advertise their apartment buildings online. According to Kip Cassino of Borrell Associates Inc., which tracks ad spending, landlords will spend $1.5 billion online in 2015, up from $630 million last year. Not surprisingly, the competition for those marketing dollars is growing. Apartments.com competes on the national level with Zillow Group Inc. and Craigslist Inc., as well as with dozens of local sites in major cities across the country. Seattle-based Zillow, a dominant player in listings for single-family homes through Zillow.com and Trulia.com, a recent acquisition, has been buying up rental-focused listing sites for several years. Purchases have included HotPads, PostLets, RentJuice and New York-focused StreetEasy. News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns Move Inc., which operates the Move.com and Realtor.com websites and mobile products that offer rental listings and competes with CoStar in the online rentals business. Zillow's chief marketing officer, Amy Bohutinsky, says her company wants to cover all the rental-housing options, not just apartments. ""There are millions of renters who are looking for a townhouse or a four-unit property or a single-family home,"" she says. ""Zillow aims to be a rental brand for all of them."" So far, no one competitor has emerged as the dominant player, says Brian Boero, a partner at 1000Watt, a digital-strategy firm that focuses on real estate. ""The rental market has been highly fragmented. It's still a wide-open category,"" he says. While Zillow is making moves in the field, he says CoStar's investment places it in a potentially strong position. ""It sounds like CoStar is looking to own this category, or at least make a splash."" In January, before Apartments.com's relaunch, it received 5.9 million unique visits, according to comScore, a web analytics firm. That number counted visits to its companion sites including ApartmentHomeLiving.com. Zillow.com's rental site received 8.1 million unique visitors, according to comScore. It is hard to track which site has the largest number of apartment listings. Apartments.com says it now tracks 770,000 rental listings at more than 462,000 apartment buildings in the U.S., up from 17,500 buildings before its overhaul. Zillow says it has about 400,000 rental listings across all of its sites. Craigslist displays a substantial number of listings, but the site is often criticized for not vetting listings for scams and accuracy. Craigslist didn't respond to requests for comment. CoStar says the revamped website is more accurate than others due to its big investment in software and researchers. Employees and ""secret shoppers"" make more than 1 million calls to apartment complexes each month. And its software searches approximately 40,000 outside apartment-rental sites and updates 90,000 listings a day. Not all investors are thrilled with CoStar's heavy spending. The company's share price dropped 6.2% to $187.90 on Feb. 17, after the company held a conference call with analysts to discuss Apartments.com. The stock is still at the upper end of its 52-week trading range, but the drop suggests that some investors are a little nervous. Tuesday afternoon in New York, the stock was at $186.08.

""At $651,000 a door, the new owners may be looking at a potential exit strategy of condo conversion because it's extremely difficult at this purchase price to achieve positive cash flow,"" said Jack McCabe, a real estate analyst in Deerfield Beach, Fla.","In the latest sign that ultraluxury apartment living is spreading far beyond New York and San Francisco, a glass-sheathed tower changed hands in Chicago last week in a deal that is shattering records. The 60-story building, named OneEleven, was sold for $328.2 million, or $651,000 per unit, the highest price ever paid per unit for an apartment building of more than 50 units in Chicago. The 504-unit building, located in Chicago's downtown Loop neighborhood, was sold by a unit of New York-based Related Cos. and was acquired by Heitman, a global real-estate investment-management firm based in Chicago. The purchase price ""is emblematic of the seemingly insatiable demand for high-quality, large real-estate assets in primary markets,"" said Ben Thypin, director of market analysis for Real Capital Analytics, a commercial-real-estate data and analysis firm in New York. Apartment rents in OneEleven, which opened just last year, range from $1,700 a month for studios to $12,000 a month for three-bedroom penthouses. For years, the conventional wisdom held that wealthy residents in Midwestern cities would almost always choose to buy a home rather than pay hefty rent. But those notions changed as homeownership has lost its allure in certain segments of the population, especially younger generations of renters who want to avoid lengthy commutes from the suburbs and some aging baby boomers and empty nesters who want to downsize. Some industry analysts speculate that OneEleven could eventually be converted to a condominium building when homeownership becomes popular again. ""At $651,000 a door, the new owners may be looking at a potential exit strategy of condo conversion because it's extremely difficult at this purchase price to achieve positive cash flow,"" said Jack McCabe, a real estate analyst in Deerfield Beach, Fla. ""My guess is that when units come on the market, the average price will probably be higher than $1 million."" Heitman declined to comment for this article. But Curt Bailey, president of Related Midwest, the Chicago office of Related Cos., agreed that condo conversion would be a logical exit strategy for OneEleven. ""I think in Chicago today the property is probably worth more as an apartment than it is as a condo,"" he said. ""But it will probably change in the future, and I think conversions may be something we begin seeing in the next 24 months or so."" OneEleven was originally slated to be a 90-story hotel-and-condo tower. The project stalled, however, when its developer ran out of money after commencing construction and reaching the 28th floor. The partially built structure was acquired by Related, in a joint venture with Clark Wacker LLC, in 2011. Related repositioned the project and restarted construction. The sale marks a big profit for Related, which spent about $180 million on the project from start to finish, according to a person familiar with the costs. ""The building has an incredible location right on the river,"" Mr. Bailey said. ""You have 50 million square feet of office space that you can walk to in five minutes, and right across the street is [the] River North [neighborhood], which has emerged as Chicago's great gathering place for restaurants and nightlife."" Chicago, like many large cities, is experiencing a strengthening job market. ""The city has done a very good job of bringing in larger companies with high-paying jobs and continuing to fuel the desire to live in the city,"" said John S. Sebree, director of the National Multi Housing Group for brokerage Marcus & Millichap. In April 2014, Motorola Mobility LLC unveiled its new 600,000-square-foot global headquarters in downtown Chicago, a return to the city after nearly 40 years in the suburbs. Other companies, such as Google Inc., have expanded their presence in the downtown area. For investors, Mr. Sebree said that Chicago is an easier first-tier market in which to buy buildings compared to other first-tier markets such as New York or San Francisco. That is resulting in strong demand by investors from New York, Canada and Asia, he said. And while prices are rising, returns are still higher in Chicago then in some other large cities. The capitalization rate, or projected return, for apartments in Chicago was 6.5% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 4.9% Los Angeles, 5.6% in Boston and 4.1% in San Francisco, according to Real Capital Analytics. Marcus & Millichap is forecasting a robust year for the Chicago apartment market, with vacancy rates and rents projected to improve even though more than 4,000 new apartments will come online in 2015. Effective rents are forecast to tick up 3.3% to $1,297 a month. Mr. Sebree predicts that Chicago will continue to attract investors due to its strong economic fundamentals. But he doesn't expect any more record-setting transactions, at least for a while. ""That's a big number that Related got,"" he said. ""That cost per unit may stand as the highest for quite a while.""

The index provider is assessing whether to include companies which trade overseas, but lack a domestic listing, in its global-equity index series. Inclusion in the index can potentially funnel billions of dollars into certain stocks by compelling passive funds to hold them, and changes to benchmarks are closely scrutinized by active managers seeking to get a head start on these flows. The issue of overseas listings had been discussed for several years but was given fresh impetus by e-commerce giant Alibaba's $25 billion initial public offering in September, said Eddie Pong, a Hong Kong-based director of research and analytics at FTSE. ""Alibaba, because of its size, triggered a significant debate,"" he said. The rule change isn't being designed with any one particular company or country in mind and should be applied in a generic fashion, he said. Other companies with listings outside their countries of origin, such as Hong Kong-listed United Co. Rusal PLC, could also be affected by such a change. About $24 billion of passive capital tracks FTSE's China indexes, Mr. Pong said. The index provider isn't working to a specific time line, he said, and already provides access to overseas listings of Chinese companies through some of its other, more-specialized benchmarks. FTSE could announce its decision at any time, Mr. Pong said, although it conducts index-reclassification reviews in March and September. MSCI, which oversees the most widely followed emerging-markets index, began a consultation in September on whether to make a similar change to its rules but has yet to make a decision. Fund managers have put pressure on index providers to add Chinese companies' overseas listings to their indexes because most major benchmarks have a heavier weighting toward ""old-economy"" stocks in heavy industry, real estate and financial services, instead of the ""new-economy"" sectors such as technology, pharmaceuticals and new energy, which are expected to benefit from the country's economic rebalancing.

The technology giant, along with fourth-quarter results, on Tuesday issued a highly anticipated profit forecast that fell below Wall Street's expectations. Big Blue, facing problems that include slowdowns in software and services, last October of earning at least $20 a share in 2015. On Tuesday, IBM forecast earnings for 2015 of $15.75 to $16.50 per share, below the $16.51 per share average estimate on Wall Street. The company's stock slid 2% in after-hours trading. Virginia Rometty, IBM's chief executive, has pushed the company to focus investments on what she calls ""strategic imperatives."" Those include cloud services, analytics technology, security and businesses related to mobile devices and social networks, which collectively grew 16% to $25 billion in 2014, the company said. ""In 2014 we made tremendous progress,"" said Martin Schroeter, IBM's chief financial officer. But the company faces headwinds affecting the remainder of its operations--particularly a rise in the value of the dollar versus foreign currencies, reducing the value of revenue IBM takes in abroad and converts to U.S. currency. Mr. Schroeter said the company over the long-term expects revenue to begin growing at ""low single-digit"" percentage rates. But he said revenue won't grow in 2015, largely because of currency effects and recent divestitures. IBM's net income fell 11% in the fourth quarter, though profit excluding one-time items easily beat analyst expectations. Its revenue fell 12%, however, dropping below Wall Street predictions and marking the 11th consecutive quarter IBM has failed to report a revenue increase. The computing pioneer, originally known for big mainframe systems, has gradually reduced its reliance on hardware by emphasizing a collection of services and software offerings. It continued that strategy in 2014, announcing to Lenovo Group Ltd. and pay Globalfoundries Inc. to take over IBM's semiconductor manufacturing business. Those actions contributed to IBM's reduction in revenue, Mr. Schroeter said, but had the positive effect of removing operations that weren't contributing to IBM's profit. The company faces remaining hardware pressures, however. Sales of servers based on a technology IBM calls Power, as well as mainframe systems, have declined as customers waited for new models. Both lines have now been updated, including a , but the results haven't showed up yet in IBM's income statement. Revenue from Power systems declined 13% in the fourth quarter, while mainframe revenues were off 26%. IBM, while expecting more revenue from fast-growing areas such as online software, has seen its older services business slow down. On Tuesday, IBM said revenue from its global technology services segment fell 7.6% from the year-earlier period to $9.17 billion, while the global business service segment logged an 8.4% drop to $4.35 billion. Software revenue, meanwhile, has been hurt by factors such as a decline in revenue from operating systems that were sold as part of the divested commodity server business. Revenue from software declined 6.9% to $7.58 billion in the latest quarter. Overall, IBM reported earnings of $5.48 billion, or $5.51 a share, down from $6.19 billion, or $5.73 a share, a year earlier. Excluding acquisition- and retirement-related costs, profit from continuing operations was $5.81 a share. Total revenue fell to $24.11 billion from $27.39 billion. Analysts expected $5.41 a share on $24.77 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. IBM's fourth-quarter results included a $580 million charge to cover costs of ""rebalancing"" the workforce, shedding some employees to make way for others with new skills, Mr. Schroeter said. In all, though, IBM hired about 45,000 people in 2014 and has about 15,000 jobs open, he said. The company hasn't provided an updated number yet for its total head count.

Doc_53,IBM Pumps $4 Billion Into Cloud and Mobile Initiatives; Tech company shifts spending plans to target faster-growing segments,"Clark, Don","IBM businesses that have posted lower revenue lately include some classes of technology services and software as well as IBM's remaining lines of big computers. Besides the System X business, IBM last year also divested its semiconductor manufacturing business to Globalfoundries Inc. in a deal that cost it $1.5 billion.","International Business Machines Corp. is in the same bind as many of its corporate-tech peers: how to foster fast-growing but unproven initiatives while lucrative older businesses are slowing down. Having identified a set of promising new directions, the company plans to invest more in them. At an annual meeting with analysts Thursday, the company announced that it will shift $4 billion in 2015 spending to what it calls the ""strategic imperatives"" of cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security technologies. The spending plan, in turn, has prompted IBM Chief Executive Virginia Rometty to set a new financial target for those faster-growth segments: $40 billion in combined annual revenue by 2018, or more than 40% of the company's expected total revenue. It is an ambitious goal. Those businesses generated $25 billion in revenue last year, 27% of total revenue, though the trend line has been rising for both figures. ""We did an awful lot last year,"" Ms. Rometty said in an interview before the meeting. ""We've reinvented this company one more time."" But more needs to be done to counteract declines in other IBM businesses. The company reported in January that total revenue from continuing operations declined 6% to $92.8 billion in 2014 and projected that total revenue wouldn't grow in 2015. The company also has run into a stiff headwind from the rising value of the dollar, which hurts IBM's income statement when sales made abroad are converted into U.S. currency. IBM, while reaffirming its 2015 outlook, on Thursday boosted its estimate for foreign-exchange rates on its revenue growth. A rise in the value of the dollar versus foreign currencies has reduced the value of revenue IBM takes in abroad and converts to U.S. currency. For its current quarter, IBM now expects currency to hurt revenue growth by more than 7 percentage points, above the hit of 6 to 7 points it projected in January. For the full year, IBM is expecting a foreign-exchange impact of more than 6 points, above previous projections for an impact of 5 to 6 points. On Thursday, Ms. Rometty described the currency difficulties the company is facing as among the most extensive in recent memory. The company in 2014 completed the sale to Lenovo Group Ltd. of its System X business in commodity-style servers; it had previously sold its personal computer business to the Chinese company. IBM said Thursday that it continues to expect a 4 percentage point impact to revenue growth in each of the first three quarters of 2015 because of the System X divestiture. IBM shares slipped 0.6% in midday trading to $161.88. Last October, IBM abandoned what turned out to be an overly ambitious long-term target of $20 per share in operating earnings by 2015. In January, it reported $16.53 per share for 2014. It also set a less-specific long-term goal of delivering ""low single-digit"" percentage growth in revenue and ""high single-digit"" growth in operating earnings per share. Based on recent investments and divestitures, Ms. Rometty said before the meeting that she has ""great confidence that we can and will achieve the long-term model we put out."" IBM businesses that have posted lower revenue lately include some classes of technology services and software as well as IBM's remaining lines of big computers. Besides the System X business, IBM last year also divested its semiconductor manufacturing business to Globalfoundries Inc. in a deal that cost it $1.5 billion. Hardware now accounts for less than 10% of IBM's total revenue, Ms. Rometty said. The changes have dispensed with businesses that were a drag on earnings, she added. Among its new priorities, IBM has put particular emphasis on online, or ""cloud,"" services. It has said it invested $1.2 billion in data centers to augment those it acquired with SoftLayer Technologies in 2013. It also invested $1 billion to accelerate commercialization of its Watson data-analytics technology. IBM's plan to invest $4 billion more on strategic initiatives won't necessarily require spending cuts in other businesses, Ms. Rometty said. In many cases, she said, the company can take advantage of money freed up by operating at higher efficiency. The company has taken charges for ""rebalancing"" its workforce--laying off some workers while hiring others with new skills--but doesn't expect to reduce overall head count. ""It's not a cost-cutting exercise,"" Ms. Rometty said of the company's actions. ""It's a very healthy remix."" Presenters at the analyst meeting in New York, besides Ms. Rometty, include IBM's chief financial officer, Martin Schroeter, cloud chief Robert LeBlanc and senior vice presidents John Kelly and Steven Mills.

Why do you have people on your payroll who don't do any productive work? Every club has them. They are euphemistically called ""squad players."" They train with their teammates all week long then either ride the pine or sit in the stands come kickoff. And yet they collect a paycheck just like everybody else. Some are young players who are still maturing, though how much they'll develop by not playing first-team games is a matter of debate. The majority, however, are veterans who generally serve a combination of the following three purposes. They provide competition to the starters, keeping them on their toes. They offer options to the manager, should he wish to change the formation or personnel. And they are a kind of insurance policy in the case of injuries or suspensions. Right up until the 1990s, at most clubs it didn't matter much how you filled out your squad. Keeping ""loyal club servants"" around was a mark of pride. There was less pressure to run clubs as break-even businesses. Wages overall were lower, but reserves made considerably less than starters, so you didn't mind having a gaggle of veterans at the club who rarely got on the pitch. Now, however, finding the right balance is much more of an imperative. And it's curious to note the different ways in which clubs approach it. It begins, of course, with the manager. Some advocate squad rotation and competition for places, usually at clubs involved in European competition like the Champions League or Europa League. Others believe that the benefits of chemistry and security outweigh those of getting the odd week off or having players in a sort of comfort zone. Barcelona, for example, lists just 23 players in its first-team, according to the club's official website. Twenty-one of them are aged 22 or older. Chelsea have registered 19 players over the age of 21 with the English Premier League. A.C. Milan, which unlike Barca and Chelsea is involved in only two competitions (Italy's Serie A and the Italian Cup) has 28 in its first-team squad. Just two are 21 or younger: 16-year-old Hachim Mastour and 20-year-old M'Baye Niang. Manchester United, which also has no European games this season, registered 24 over-21 players with the league, plus 11 under-21s, two of whom went to the World Cup last summer-- Luke Shaw and Adnan Januzaj. It seems counterintuitive. You would expect those clubs likely to play fewer matches to have fewer veteran players on their books and vice-versa. But that's not the way it works out for these four. The impression is that Chelsea and Barcelona are the more rational actors here. Very broadly speaking, by having fewer senior players on their books they can either save themselves some money or pay higher wages to those who actually get on the pitch and determine results. Furthermore, Chelsea has a manager, Josê© Mourinho, who doesn't often rotate and is a proponent of smaller squads. In Barcelona's case, the roster size is mitigated by the fact that it can call upon players from the ""B"" team, which is currently in the Spanish second-tier. United and Milan, on the other hand, are somewhat tougher to wrap your head around. United Manager Louis van Gaal has used no fewer than 31 players in the Premier League alone--though two have since been loaned out (Nani and Javier Hernandez) and another two, Michael Keane and Danny Welbeck, have been sold. Van Gaal's Milan counterpart, Pippo Inzaghi, has used 25 (and, again, one of them, Fernando Torres, has now moved on). That would suggest either a penchant for rotation or, more likely, since both managers are new to their jobs, a willingness to experiment and try different solutions. Still, as the bean counters will tell you, all those extra bodies on the payroll show up on the P+L account. And, in an age of Financial Fair Play restrictions, that matters. This ought to be fertile ground for analytics types. Figuring out how many veterans you actually need--and whether it matters that they're veterans because they tend to earn far more than youngsters--and determining what resources to devote to them. You would take into account the likelihood of injury, suspension and loss of form over the course of a season, as well as the coach's proclivity for squad rotation. Do that and you might find that, if you're a team in European competition, when it comes to veterans you don't really need more than 16 or 17 outfield players plus two goalkeepers. The rest can be youngsters, ideally home-grown. Because, truth be told, the number of times per season you need to reach down to ""number 20"" or beyond in your squad hierarchy is rather small. And, when it does happen, the negative impact of having to turn to a promising, hungry teenager to replace a veteran is equally tiny. Especially when the alternative in those circumstances --fielding a senior pro who hasn't played in months and might be frustrated at the lack of minutes --might not offer much more security. No doubt there are eggheads out there doing precisely such analyses. Equally certain is the fact that too many clubs evidently aren't listening to them.

While finance, marketing and other departments within a company receive customized data and analytics systems, human resources is still left with big data hand-me-downs. ""There is no one-size-fits-all blueprint for big-data infrastructure. Companies invest heavily to customize big-data and analytics tools, often on a department-by-department basis, to ensure the insights inform specific needs and strategies. Unfortunately for human resources, it is often revenue-driving departments that receive customized tools, leaving human resources to make use of infrastructure that simply doesn't fit. ""Human-resource departments generate and collect more data than most other areas of a company, but our attempts to claim big data for our own often get mired in technology infrastructure and analytics tools that were never intended to meet the needs of a modern HR organization. ""For many human-resources departments, it can be challenging to manage large amounts of diverse employee information, typically captured by different systems and providers.

""One area of promise that could be enabled by more customized tools is performance management. With more sophisticated data analytics, we can model the future success of employees or assess the potential for success of candidates. Rather than performance evaluations occurring once or twice a year, we can continuously integrate data and provide feedback to employees in a much more dynamic way, creating a performance process instead of a performance event.

In an interview ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show, B.K. Yoon, Samsung's top executive in charge of its consumer-electronics business, said Tizen TV sets will be available in the U.S. and Korea first, and the company will gradually roll them out in other markets later this year. ""We've been at [Tizen development] for years and a lot of money was spent,"" Mr. Yoon said. ""We're going to continue upgrading the platform."" Samsung is widening the use of Tizen to beef up its own internal software capabilities as it attempts to compete better with Google Inc. and Apple Inc. in the more lucrative market for software and services. The South Korean company, whose profit from mobile phones has tumbled amid stiff competition, has been developing Tizen as an alternative to Google's Android mobile operating system for many years. But because of a lack of interest from app developers, Samsung has delayed the launch of a Tizen-based smartphone several times. The majority of Samsung's smartphones use Android, but Google controls the user experience and is increasingly tightening rules on how much Android handset makers such as Samsung can modify their phones to attract new consumers. Android and Apple's iOS have a tight grip on the mobile-operating-system market, together holding more than a 95% share, according to third-quarter data from Strategy Analytics, making it difficult for alternative operating systems such as Tizen or Microsoft Corp.'s Windows to compete. But launching Tizen on TVs could have its merits, analysts say, as Samsung already holds a dominant position in the TV category with roughly one-third of the global market. There isn't a dominant or unified platform for Internet-connected TVs yet so the market is up for grabs. Rival LG Electronics Inc. is competing with Samsung through its WebOS platform, the business it acquired from Hewlett-Packard Co. in 2013. Meanwhile, efforts by Google to power TVs haven't taken off despite years of development. ""If we have our own [TV] platform it will give us much greater flexibility in what we want to do,"" Mr. Yoon said. He added that a Tizen-based smartphone is still scheduled to be launched this year in India, but declined to provide more specifics. Mr. Yoon said Tizen might have a better chance of succeeding in the TV market because it isn't as reliant as smartphones on the availability of applications. Tizen also allows for low power consumption and less memory, he said. Tizen also could make it easier for users to switch from watching traditional TV channels to other Web-based video streaming platforms such as YouTube, Samsung said. ""There could be other forms of Web-connected Samsung TVs, but they will be eventually switched to Tizen-powered ones,"" Mr. Yoon said. Whether Samsung can succeed with Tizen, though, still isn't assured, given the company's difficulties in introducing a smartphone. But Samsung's revamped software ambition is tied closely to its bigger goal of carving out a solid position in the era of the so-called Internet of Things, an idea in which many devices will come with Internet connectivity. ""We need an open ecosystem so that IoT devices can work together, and we need to collaborate across industries,"" Mr. Yoon said during a keynote speech at CES on Monday. ""Samsung is prepared to play a leading role."" Samsung says it aims to enable Internet connectivity in all of its TVs by 2017 and expand connectivity to other consumer electronics within the next five years. It hopes to spur a replacement cycle for TVs and home appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines by embedding more software functions that it hopes will help boost sales, which have been lackluster for several years. Samsung's consumer-electronics business accounted for 24% of its total sales of 47.4 trillion won ($43 billion) in the third quarter of 2014, with mobile phones still making up the bulk. But even Mr. Yoon expressed doubt about whether the company can generate a profit from these initiatives soon. ""Everyone knows that a huge change is due when all things become connected and that relevant businesses will grow. But we don't know how big that will be,"" he said, forecasting fresh revenue streams from Samsung's new Internet-connected devices in 2016 or 2017. Analysts say Samsung can't risk losing out on the opportunity to control its software and services. ""If they can't do it internally, they have to do [mergers and acquisitions] or find a way to have software capabilities equipped,"" said Lee Seung-woo, an analyst with IBK Securities in Seoul. ""That's the only way they will survive the looming change.""

""We're going to slowly try to build an (software) ecosystem around areas we can have more control over,"" the person said on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. LG, a latecomer to the market, has introduced a few smartwatches powered by Google software, with one of the more recent models, called the G Watch R, running on the Android Wear operating system. Another person familiar with the matter said LG has plans to release another smartwatch that can make calls without having to be linked to a smartphone early this year. But the person wouldn't say which operating system it would run. The move to adopt WebOS highlights LG's internal software ambitions. WebOS from Hewlett-Packard Co. in 2013. At the time, the acquisition surprised the industry because the operating system was a flop under H-P when it launched on smartphones to compete with Android and Apple Inc.'s iOS. But since its acquisition, LG has adopted WebOS in a variety of products, such as televisions, and is considering using the platform for its home appliances, the person said. LG redesigned the software to suit television sets instead of mobile phones and launched its first WebOS-powered television last year. It now plans to expand the use of the platform to power all of its Internet-connected televisions this year. LG executives say the move has, thus far, brought satisfying results. The company said in June 2014 that it shipped more than 1.1 million WebOS-based televisions, which compares to some 20,000 mobile devices sold through H-P. LG is the world's second largest seller of televisions by sales after crosstown rival Samsung Electronics Co. For smartphones, LG, like many other phone-makers including Samsung, has been relying heavily on Android. But South Korean technology companies are attempting to nurture a platform that they can have more control over by introducing them in other products that don't have a dominant platform. At CES this week, Samsung, for example, outlined plans to widely adopt its homegrown Tizen operating system on televisions after several failed attempts to introduce them on smartphones. The person said that Android would remain the major platform that powers LG's mobile devices in the near future, taking a skeptical tone on the possibility of bringing back WebOS to its smartphones. ""It isn't a technology issue. There is a prevailing system and people are used to that, which is hard to change,"" the person said. In smartphones, Android and iOS captured more than 95% of the market in the third quarter, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.

The U.S. currency's modest gains follow losses Wednesday in the wake of surprisingly cautious minutes from the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which mentioned more risks to the U.S. economy than the central bank previously had expressed or than investors expected. The market possibly overreacted to the tone of the FOMC minutes, said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at the currency brokerage Commonwealth Foreign Exchange. As it digests the Federal Reserve's message in the wake of better jobs data, investors will likely conclude there is considerable scope for rates to rise around midyear, he said. ""The minutes may be taken with a grain of salt, given that the data the Fed follows -- for the labor market and wages -- have been trending higher,"" Mr. Esiner said. ""This morning's data probably reinforces that notion, which helps the dollar."" BONDS: U.S. government bonds pulled back Thursday as investors took some chips off the table following a rally in the previous session. Bond prices soared Wednesday after the minutes for the Federal Reserve's January monetary policy meeting signaled no rush to raise official interest rates for the first time since 2006. But analysts caution that the Fed's outlook could change if growth gains further traction or inflation picks up speed. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen's testimony next week before lawmakers will be highly scrutinized.

Traders said Treasury bond prices were also hurt by a $9 billion sale of 30-year Treasury inflation-protected securities Thursday afternoon. COMMODITIES: New evidence of surging U.S. oil supplies sent prices on a roller-coaster ride, reflecting the growing divide among traders over whether an eight-month rout is over. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said oil inventories grew by 7.7 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 13. Analysts said swelling stockpiles are a sign that producers aren't cutting back on output despite a more than 50% collapse in prices since last summer. In its report, the EIA said U.S. oil production was on track to reach a 42-year high this month. But traders in the futures market had been bracing for much worse, and many took the data as a cue to buy. On Wednesday, an industry group had estimated a jump of 14.3 million barrels for last week, which would have been a record had it been borne out in the government data. U.S. oil futures, at one point down more than 5%, ended the day off by 1.9% at $51.16 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the international benchmark, briefly turned positive and settled down 0.5% at $60.21 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. The weekly U.S. supply data is shaping a debate within the oil market about whether prices have hit bottom. Prices rallied this month, reaching a high for the year on Tuesday, buoyed in part by reports that U.S. producers were cutting back on drilling. But many investors and analysts still harbor doubts about whether prices are low enough to curb production or spur new demand, two ingredients needed for a rebound. The uncertainty has triggered huge daily price moves in both directions this year. ""I think there's a bit of a fight going on"" between bearish investors concerned about high supplies today and bulls who expect low prices to lead to production cuts, said Bart Melek, head of commodities strategy at TD Securities. ""The market is a little bit over-optimistic...there's an awful lot of crude still coming into inventory."" Gold prices advanced as traders' hopes that the Federal Reserve would delay raising interest rates outweighed pressure from a potential debt deal for Greece.

Callahan told analysts on a conference call.","McGraw Hill Financial Inc. hinted Thursday at a new appetite for acquisitions and share buybacks as it emerges from a series of legal headaches that cost the firm more than $1.5 billion. The New York company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $846 million due to several settlements that resolved government lawsuits and investigations targeting its Standard & Poor's Ratings Services unit. The cases involved S&P's ratings of mortgage-bond deals before and after the 2008 financial crisis. With those legal problems resolved, McGraw Hill can resume share repurchases and be more open to adding debt for acquisitions or other moves, Chief Financial Officer Jack F. Callahan told analysts on a conference call. ""It is a new time for us,"" Mr. Callahan said. The potential for a steep settlement to resolve the litigation had been a drag on McGraw Hill's shares, which rose 4.1% Thursday to $102.19. It also meant the company had to take a more conservative stance toward issuing debt, making large acquisitions and buying back shares. The company ""has removed the regulatory overhang, a key positive as we head into 2015,"" said Joseph D. Foresi, an analyst for Janney Capital Markets, in a Thursday note to investors. In recent years, McGraw Hill has sold its education division, trade publications and construction units as it focuses on financial information provided by its credit-ratings unit, as well as commodities pricing and equities indexes divisions. McGraw Hill also owns S&P Capital IQ, a market-analytics division. Excluding the settlements and other items, earnings from continuing operations were 95 cents a share. Revenue grew 7% to $1.29 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of 90 cents a share and revenue of $1.28 billion. S&P Ratings Services, McGraw Hill's biggest unit, posted revenue of $618 million for the quarter, an increase of 8%. During the final three months of 2014, the unit benefited from a robust market in the U.S. for high-quality corporate debt and public finance, Chief Executive Officer Douglas Peterson told analysts. But the European markets declined, he added. ""This mirrors the macroeconomic trends of growth in the U.S. and uncertainty that we saw in the fourth quarter in Europe,"" Mr. Peterson said. Credit-rating firms like S&P and rivals Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings are paid by debt issuers to grade the risk levels of their bonds. When capital markets are active, ratings firms see a boost in revenue. Most investors use ratings when purchasing many types of bonds. McGraw Hill's other business units also grew. S&P Capital IQ saw its quarterly revenue increase 5% to $318 million, while revenue at S&PDow Jones Indices rose 8% to $140 million. For 2015, McGraw Hill said it expects to post per-share earnings of $4.35 to $4.45 and revenue growth in the mid single-digits.

The reviews are in early stages and it isn't known yet if the discussions will lead to any action, these people said. The broad assessment of Moody's business practices includes states other than Connecticut and Mississippi, which previously filed lawsuits against Moody's arguing the firm inflated mortgage-bond ratings to win business. A Moody's spokesman declined to comment about the potential of other state cases. The interest from multiple states, which hadn't previously been reported, is the latest example of how attention is shifting to Moody's in the wake of a record industry settlement reached this week with larger rival Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. S&P agreed to pay $1.5 billion to end more than 20 lawsuits from the Justice Department, various states and the country's largest public pension fund alleging the firm compromised standards. Investors rely on the bond grades issued by Moody's, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings. Collectively, they issue about 95% of ratings. In recent months the Justice Department quietly ramped up a separate investigation of Moody's as it met with multiple former executives to discuss how they rated complex securities before the crisis, said people familiar with the situation. It is unclear if the federal investigation will result in a lawsuit, the people said.

The suits under way, which include cases brought by the attorneys general offices of Connecticut and Mississippi and the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, are ""uniformly"" in the early stages, he said. ""There's not a lot of new news on the litigation front,"" Mr. McDaniel said. A company spokesman added: ""We continue to believe the states' and Calpers cases are without merit as to Moody's."" Moody's shares jumped 5.1% Friday as the company reported a 14% rise in fourth-quarter earnings compared with a year earlier, topping analysts' expectations. Revenue in the period ended Dec. 31 rose 13% to $877.5 million. The Moody's Investors Service debt-rating unit reported $565.1 million in revenue for the fourth quarter, an increase of 7%. Meanwhile, its analytics unit, which accounts for about one-third of revenue, rose 23% to $312.4 million. Moody's also got an earnings boost from paying a lower corporate tax rate of 28.1% in the fourth quarter compared with 30.6% a year earlier. Michael Calia contributed to this article.

The deal, which will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and debt, will make Nasdaq's global indexes segment one of the largest providers of the fast-growing smart-beta indexes. Unlike traditional market capitalization weighted indexes, smart-beta shifts the index weightings based on certain factors. ""Our index business has been a strong growth area for Nasdaq over the last decade,"" President Adena Friedman said. The deal is expected to add to the company's earnings after closing and shouldn't affect financial leverage or capital return strategy, Nasdaq said. Nasdaq will now have DWA's 17 exchange-traded funds in addition to its existing 69 smart-beta ETFs. Its global indexes will have nearly $45 billion assets benchmarked to its smart-beta indexes, and more than $105 billion benchmarked to all Nasdaq Indexes. The acquisition should also have opportunities for licensing, since DWA licenses to ETF providers First Trust and PowerShares. Nasdaq plans to facilitate international expansion of DWA's services beginning in Canada and Europe. It also intends to enhance DWA's web-advisor and modeling tools, as the market moves toward model-based investing.

Weather Experts Trusted the Model That Had Served Better at Predicting Superstorm Sandy,Robert Lee Hotz,"The National Weather Service had recently improved its own system, called the Global Forecast System, and its forecast correctly predicted that the storm would go farther out to sea, away from New York City.","National Weather Service experts misjudged the path and impact of the blizzard that struck the Northeast on Monday and Tuesday, in large part because they trusted the wrong forecasting model, several independent meteorologists said. Rather than rely on their own forecasting system--upgraded in recent weeks--the federal experts placed their faith instead on a well-regarded European computer model that predicted the worst of this storm would squarely hit New York City . That system earlier had outperformed the U.S. forecasting system in predicting the path of superstorm Sandy. This time, the European forecasting model was wrong, several commercial forecasters said. That model, one of four complex computer simulations normally used to calculate weather patterns along the Eastern seaboard, predicted that the heaviest snow would fall between 50 and 100 miles farther west than actually occurred. Still, it correctly calculated the broader outlines of the blizzard. As predicted, the storm pounded parts of Long Island, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Maine, with winds in excess of 50 mph and snow in some locales up to 30 inches deep. ""Too much trust was based on a single model, and there was not enough emphasis on uncertainty,"" said Jeff Masters, chief meteorologist at Weather Underground, a commercial forecasting service. ""The European model was about 100 miles off. That is a big deal for a heavy snow situation."" The National Weather Service had recently improved its own system, called the Global Forecast System, and its forecast correctly predicted that the storm would go farther out to sea, away from New York City. Joe D'Aleo, chief forecaster at Weatherbell Analytics LLC, a commercial forecasting company based in New York, said the revamped system was perhaps still too new to be considered completely reliable. ""It has not been battle-tested,"" he said. Even so, some uncertainty is the norm. ""The models are very rarely exactly on track,"" Mr. D'Aleo. The National Weather Service in Washington, D.C., didn't respond to an inquiry about its forecasting models today. In a statement this morning, the service's New York office said, ""The science of forecasting storms, while continually improving, still can be subject to error, especially if we're on the edge of the heavy precipitation shield. Efforts, including research, are already under way to more easily communicate that forecast uncertainty.""

The front-month March contract settled up 7.4 cents, or 2.8%, at $2.754 a million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It traded at losses for large parts of the morning before rallying to its biggest one-day gain in a week. The Northeast is going to be at the epicenter of a cold front with temperatures reaching around 15-degrees-Fahernheit-below normal by mid-February, according to models from WeatherBELL Analytics LLC in New York. Several meteorologists had been predicting February cold limited to the Northeast, but WeatherBELL is showing midmonth temperatures at least five-degrees-Fahrenheit-below normal covering the country as far west as the Mississippi River. The forecasters called it ""scary cold."" ""At the very least it is showing that trend to expand this cold westward in a more permanent fashion,"" WeatherBELL analysts wrote in a note to clients. ""This borders on incomprehensible cold in the Northeast."" For the rally to last, traders will need to see that cold weather disrupting supply, Aaron Calder, senior market analyst at energy-consulting firm Gelber Associates in Houston, said in a note to clients. If the cold created strong demand and supply disruptions for two to three weeks, it could cause inventory concerns, he said. Prices had been sliding because of robust supply growth outweighing tepid demand. Natural-gas consumption is usually strongest in the winter, because half of U.S. households use natural gas as their primary heating fuel. But the country would have needed a severe winter to absorb the record supply coming from the shale gas boom, and temperatures have been relatively normal instead. RBC Capital Markets on Tuesday cut its forecast price for natural gas futures by 13.3% to $3.25/mmBtu for 2015. It expects production to keep growing by 3.5% this year despite the steep drop in prices since November. Nicole Friedman contributed to this article.

Gas has rallied for two days, pushing its strongest day of gains and back-to-back gains, by percentage, since mid-February. Futures are up nearly 16% since Monday's close. The move demonstrates how powerful a force winter can still be at boosting the market, analysts and traders said. Record production, tepid demand from a mild December and predictions for a warmer-than-normal late January had led to a massive selloff, dropping prices by more than a third since November. But the late-January forecasts are reversing course, boosting expectations for gas demand to heat homes. ""This should get the market's attention that there's still some demand to be dealt with here,"" said John Kilduff, founding partner of Again Capital in New York. Late last week he said he was buying futures contracts, predicting that prices would soon surge above $3 a million British thermal units. ""The market had just gotten ahead of itself with prices."" The front-month February contract settled up 29 cents, or 9.9%, at $3.233/mmBtu on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It set a new three-week high closing price and intraday price. A relaxed Pacific Jetstream is looking more likely for the last week of the month, increasing the chance for an arctic blast to hit the country, Weather Services International in Andover, Mass., said in its morning update. It probably won't be extreme enough to set any record-low temperatures, though, said Phil Vida, lead forecaster at MDA Weather Services. In the major markets for gas-heating demand, Chicago looks like it will have the coldest spell, about 5-degrees-Fahernheit below normal, according to MDA's forecast. The swing does change the overall look for January, making the whole month colder than average, meteorologists said. It adds to a cold start to the month that sent demand for natural gas as high as 129 billion cubic feet a day, its fifth highest since 2005, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. About half of all U.S. homes use gas for heat, making winter the common peak for prices. That strong demand is likely to show up in this week's EIA storage update. Storage levels likely fell by 231 bcf, 22% more than average, in the week that ended Friday, according to the average forecast of 18 analysts and traders surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. The EIA is scheduled to release its storage data for the week on Thursday at 10:30 a.m. EST. That type of demand, combined with the weather, is forcing bears out of the market before that EIA update, traders said. Bets from money managers this month had been largely in favor of falling prices. Many of those investors now have to scramble to buy in and close out those bets as the weather and stronger demand start to turn the market against them. ""You've got to take the money off the table,"" said John Woods, president of JJ Woods Associates and a Nymex trader who had also been betting on rising prices in the past week. ""Everything indicates a move upward, so they're just jumping...beforehand. Those who didn't will probably lose out."" Longer-term forecasts also suggest this won't be the end of severe cold. Both Commodity Weather Group and WeatherBELL Analytics released seasonal updates Wednesday reaffirming their predictions for a cold end to winter. Commodity Weather Group says ""February cold could rival 2014 levels at times,"" referring to the polar front that set record-lows nationwide last year and sent gas prices up to nearly $6.50/mmBtu. WeatherBELL calls unseasonably warm weather forecasted for next week ""an isle in a sea of cold."" It predicts the Midwest and South will average temperatures 2- to 6-degrees-Fahernheit below normal from February through April.

The inflation rate likely rose to 5.4% in December from a year earlier due to higher food prices, according to a poll of 14 economists by The Wall Street Journal. It was at 4.38% in November, the lowest since the series was introduced in January 2012. Economists also predict wholesale prices rose 0.5% in December. They were flat in November, which was a first in more than five years. The government will issue the consumer-inflation data Monday and wholesale-prices data Wednesday. ""Inflation has eased as food prices fall,"" Moody's Analytics said in a research note. ""This will pave the way for an interest-rate cut in the first half of 2015, possibly as early as February or March,"" it added. Consumer inflation, which is the main measure guiding the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy, has declined sharply from a peak of 11.16% in November 2013 thanks to improved food supplies and a more than 55% drop in global oil prices since June. In the past few months, the inflation readings have also benefited from a high statistical base in 2013 when inflation rates were hovering at double-digit levels. Economists say December's print will be the first when the base effect would have normalized and unmask the true picture of how strong price pressures actually are. Most economists predict a mild resurgence but say that it would still remain well below the RBI's 8% target for January, making it hard for the central bank to refuse a rate cut much longer. ""Even the most pessimistic inflation projections suggest that the bounce back in headline price pressures that the RBI was worried about will likely be subdued,"" said Jyotinder Kaur, an economist at HDFC Bank. ""This will make it difficult for the RBI to hold on to its wait and watch approach to tackling the slack in growth,"" she added. At its latest review in December, the RBI indicated it wants to see more proof that inflation won't breach its target once the effect of the favorable statistical base fades. The central bank said it could lower rates early this year if the broader trend continues to show an easing in prices and the government takes steps to improve its finances. Most economists say the government's progress in improving finances will become clear when it presents the annual budget next month. The RBI may deliver a cut thereafter, some economists add. Industry lobby groups have been pressing for a rate cut. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also recently said that cost of capital for businesses needs to be lowered to support the economy, which the government projects would expand 5.5% in the year through March, better than the below-5% growth in the past two years.

Kantar Worldpanel ComTech said Apple's iOS operating system accounted for 47.4% of U.S. smartphone sales in the three months ended November, nearly equal to Android's 48.4% share during the same period. Apple gained 4.3 percentage points from its share in the same period a year earlier, while Android fell two percentage points. That marked Android's first decline in U.S. market share since September 2013 when Apple introduced the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C. Kantar's report is the latest indication of very strong demand for Apple's latest iPhones.

Since their launch on Sept. 19, Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been in short supply. The phones are finding an eager audience hungry for larger screen sizes, after Apple long resisted such a move. ""It's more of a level playing field than it has been in [the] last couple of years, but I don't think it's the start of a long-term shift,"" said Carolina Milanesi, chief of research at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.

""Android is paying the price overall for the struggles of Samsung,"" said Ms. Milanesi. Daisuke Wakabayashi August, the Smart Lock, Expands Into Wi-Fi A startup called August helped popularize the idea of a smart door lock that can be controlled by someone with a smartphone app. But there are limits to its flagship product--the phone has to be close to the lock, for one--and August plans to address those issues with a second gadget called the August Connect. The $49 device, which was launched at the Consumer Electronics Show on Wednesday, plugs into a wall socket and wirelessly connects to other devices in the home as well as to August's lock. ""We very much believe that consumers are going to have existing products in the home, or will be acquiring other devices or service,"" says Jason Johnson, August's co-founder and chief executive. ""They are going to want to bring August into that experience."" The original August lock was designed to communicate using the short-range Bluetooth technology found in recent smartphones. Until now, commands have only traveled from the handset to the lock. Bluetooth uses less power than other options like Wi-Fi, helping to extend the battery life of the lock. But there is a downside: no connection to the Internet, so users can't open doors when they are away from home or tell whether their doors are locked. August Connect is designed to fix that. It has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so it can communicate with the lock and other devices in the home, as well as the Web. Users won't only be able to remotely check on a lock but also receive notifications about lock activity and ""buzz in"" people who may not have smartphones, August said.

Doc_70,New York's Baccarat Hotel Fetches Record Valuation From Chinese Buyer; China's Sunshine Insurance Group to Pay More Than $2 Million Per Room,"Karmin, Craig; Fung, Esther","Because hotels aren't preleased like office buildings, the risk of filling the guest rooms now falls to the new owner, rather than the developer, he said.","New York's Baccarat Hotel has yet to check in a single guest, but it is about to become the most highly valued hotel in the U.S. after a Chinese insurer agreed to buy it for more than $230 million. Sunshine Insurance Group Co. is paying real-estate mogul Barry Sternlicht's firm and a partner more than $2 million a room for the Midtown Manhattan property, according to people familiar with the matter. One person said the valuation beats the previous record set by the Plaza Hotel, the New York landmark that was sold in 2012 to India's Sahara Group for $2.04 million a room, according to hotel data tracker STR Analytics. The Baccarat is the latest trophy property to wind up in the hands of Chinese investors in recent months as buyers take advantage of new rules allowing them to invest more easily abroad. Real-estate brokers and analysts said Chinese companies see luxury hotels, especially in major global capitals, as long-term investments that can provide steady income in a period of low interest rates. Moreover, some say the properties confer prestige on their owners. ""Chinese insurers are buying for 50 or 100 years, and they are not worried about value going down in markets like New York,"" said Ryan Meliker, hotel analyst for investment bank MLV & Co. ""It's a great place to park money long term."" China's Anbang Insurance Group Co. in October agreed to pay $1.95 billion to Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. for the famed Waldorf-Astoria on New York's Park Avenue. China property investor Dalian Wanda Group Co. last year put $900 million toward a Chicago skyscraper with a luxury hotel. Chinese investors also have bought hotels in Sydney, Washington and Los Angeles in the past year. Real-estate broker JLL estimates Chinese companies will spend more than $5 billion on overseas hotel investments this year, up from $920 million last year and $130 million in 2012. The Chinese government's recent liberalization of rules that had limited corporate investments abroad is helping to fuel the buying, said Gilda Perez-Alvarado, head of the Americas for JLL's global hotel group. Under the new rules, Chinese firms can invest up to $1 billion without seeking government approval, up from $100 million before last year's changes. Mr. Sternlicht's Starwood Capital Group LLC built the luxury hotel and high-end condominium project with Tribeca Associates, a New York real-estate developer. The two haven't disclosed how much they spent on the project. Starwood, which acquired French crystal maker Baccarat in 2005, will continue to manage its namesake hotel. Mr. Sternlicht founded Starwood in 1991, and it has expanded into one of the world's largest real-estate investment firms. He also was chief executive of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. before leaving the company in 2005. The opulent 114-room property features 15,000 pieces of crystal stemware and 17 chandeliers from France's Baccarat factory. Minibars are stuffed with treats from Parisian gourmet shop Fauchon, and the property features a spa offering six kinds of facials. Suites are expected to fetch up to $18,000 a night. The Baccarat is slated to open its doors next month. It is rare for a buyer to commit to a luxury property that has no track record and no guarantee it can get the $900 to $1,000 a night that Starwood plans to charge for standard rooms. That makes it a more speculative investment than the Plaza Hotel, which has been operating for more than a century. ""This only occurs in very robust market conditions,"" said Sean Hennessey, chief executive officer of Lodging Advisors, a hotel-consulting firm. Because hotels aren't preleased like office buildings, the risk of filling the guest rooms now falls to the new owner, rather than the developer, he said. Some brokers said that if the Baccarat can charge what it hopes, the hotel could be valued at more than what Sunshine is paying. Hotels also are the most resistant type of property to inflation because room rates can be reset at any time. A luxury hotel like the Baccarat should produce annual adjusted operating income of about 3% to 4% of the purchase price, or roughly twice the yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, said Mr. Meliker, the MLV analyst. There are also strategic reasons for closely held Sunshine to buy before the opening, Mr. Hennessey said. The company gets a new asset in a crucial market without having to wait years to develop a similar property. This isn't the first wave of foreign buying of trophy U.S. commercial properties. Japanese conglomerates were big buyers during the 1980s, and there has been a steady stream in recent years of petrodollars from Middle Eastern and Asian government funds. Chinese insurers have been particularly active buying hotels and other real estate overseas. Only about 1% of these insurers' assets are in real estate, said JLL's Ms. Perez-Alvarado, who expects that number to climb closer to the 4% she says is more common among Western insurers. Sunshine was established in 2005 as a property and casualty insurer, later adding a life-insurance unit and asset-management arm. Its website says the company has more than 130 million customers. In November, Sunshine agreed to pay $380 million for a Sheraton hotel in Sydney. The Baccarat sale would follow a record-breaking year for the hospitality industry. U.S. hotels had their highest-ever average daily rate of $115 a night and revenue per available room of $74, according to STR. Leisure travel remained robust, while group travel rebounded 4.4% in 2014 after a 0.7% decline the year before. Scott Berman, head of the hospitality group for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, said 2015 looks just as strong. He points to an improving U.S. economy aided by falling oil prices, continued strength in business travel and limited new supply in most cities. In 2013, foreign buyers invested $229 million in Manhattan hotels, just 12% of the total investment that year. Last year, foreign investors accounted for $1.9 billion, or 58%, of Manhattan's total hotel investment, according to JLL. The Waldorf Astoria sale alone would match all of last year's foreign hotel investment in Manhattan. Anbang is expected to close its deal to acquire the landmark property sometime during the first quarter, according to people familiar with the matter. The $1.95 billion price tag, or about $1.4 million a room, would be the highest overall price paid for a U.S. hotel. Broker Eastdil Secured advised the sellers on the Baccarat and Waldorf sales.

Doc_71,Norway Fund Bulks Up on Real Estate,"Pirolo, Alessia; Kjetil Malkenes Hovland",None available.,"Norway's state-run investment fund is becoming one of the world's biggest landlords at a time when other big commercial property owners are sounding alarms about high prices. The $874 billion Government Pension Fund of Norway, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, last year purchased $7.6 billion worth of property globally, more than any other sovereign fund, according to data from real-estate tracker Real Capital Analytics. The push is part of a broader strategy to improve returns by taking on more risk. The fund, which has generated an annual return of 3.7% since 1998, aims over time to boost its real-estate holdings to 5% from the current 1.3%. Earlier this month, the fund closed on its purchase of a 45% stake in a 40-story skyscraper at 11 Times Square in Manhattan for $401.9 million, a deal that valued the 1.1 million square foot property at $1,273 a square foot, which is at the high end of the range of prices being paid for Midtown office buildings in recent years. In January, meanwhile, the fund beat six other bidders in London for Queensberry House, a 75,000-square-foot retail and office building, agreeing to pay 190.6 million ($294.6 million.) The seller, Sorgente Group SpA, had paid 167 million for the property in 2012. But some experts question the timing of the Norway fund's strategy of bulking up on office buildings, stores, warehouses and other commercial property in Europe and the U.S. Prices have risen so rapidly in the past two years that seasoned investors have begun to move to the sidelines even as Norway piles in. ""Asset prices today are high, and acquisitions are getting dicey,"" said Steven Roth, chief executive of Vornado Realty Trust, a leading U.S. real-estate investment trust, on an investor call earlier this month. ""We are now at the point in the cycle where the easy money has been made, and it seems to me that this is a better time to harvest than to invest."" As a sign of how high values have risen in London, office building investors in December paid prices that will give them an initial yield of just 4% from the incomes of the properties, according to data from Real Capital Analytics. That was the lowest level since 2008. The Norway fund is the main vehicle through which the Norwegian people benefit from the country's position as the world's third-largest gas exporter and the 10th-largest oil exporter. Its assets have more than doubled since 2010, and its current value is equal to about $170,000 per Norwegian citizen. The fund, which launched in 1990 and received its first cash transfers in 1996, initially invested only in stocks and bonds. But average annual returns have fallen short of the government's long-term return target of 4%. Hoping to boost returns, the government in 2010 allowed the fund to invest up to 5% of its value in real estate. Norwegian central bank governor êÄystein Olsen in a speech earlier this month said that with long-term government bond yields near zero, Norway's fund return could drop ""perhaps below 3%."" The fund also has been hurt by falling global energy prices, which have cut cash transfers from the Norwegian government. A spokeswoman for Norges Bank Investment Management, which oversees the fund, said it is trying to achieve the ""highest possible return with a moderate risk level."" Asked about the timing of the fund's increased appetite for real estate, she said: ""We are a long-term investor"" and that the fund's strategy is to focus on large global cities like New York and San Francisco where ""the prospects for solid long-term return are good."" The fund has been especially active in the U.S. In 2014, Norway was the second-largest foreign investor in U.S. real estate, after Canada, thanks mainly to acquisitions by its sovereign-wealth fund, according to a report by CBRE Group Inc. Norwegian real-estate investments in the U.S. totaled $4.4 billion in 2014, up 120% from 2013, the report said. Yet only 1.3% of the fund's portfolio was in real estate as of the third quarter of 2014. That means it will take much more buying to meet the 5% target--at a time when prices have risen sharply from their recession lows. In the U.S., values are at record levels, 17% above their precrash high in 2007, according to Green Street. Fund executives in June said they planned to invest an additional 1% of its value each year in real estate through 2016. Last year, the fund also hired a separate executive group for real estate and plans to add 200 people to its staff of around 400 by 2016. Some real-estate investors question the fund's strategy of paying top-dollar for properties. While annual income for well-leased top-quality properties typically amounts to between 4% and 4.5% of a property's sale price, Norway has made multiple purchases in which the income is below 4%, a low number in the real-estate sector. When the fund paid $1.8 billion for a 45% interest in a portfolio of towers from Boston Properties last fall, the income amounted to 3.9% of the purchase price, according to Real Capital Analytics LLC. And when it bought a 49% stake in a San Francisco office property named Foundry Square II in September, the income amounted to 2.9%, according to Real Capital.

Doc_72,Jack Meyer's Convexity Suffers Investor Exodus; Investors Pull $3 Billion From Fund Over Past Year,"Copeland, Rob","By the firm's own metrics, Convexity has fallen short of benchmarks by 2.4, 3.7 and 0.3 percentage points in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, the documents show. Since inception, Convexity has beaten benchmarks by an average of 3.73 percentage points a year.","One of the investment world's biggest stars has lost some of his shine. Jack Meyer, who more than quadrupled the size of Harvard University's endowment in nearly 15 years at its helm, is in a yearslong skid at his Boston-based hedge-fund firm. Investors are taking notice: They have pulled $3 billion out of Convexity Capital Management LP over the past year after a period of performance the firm itself described as ""not good,"" ""disappointing,"" and ""the worst of times,"" according to investor documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and people familiar with the firm. The withdrawals are among the latest signs that even the hedge-fund world's marquee names are finding it hard to cope with low interest rates engineered by central banks around the world and muted swings in prices of stocks, bonds and other assets. Hedge funds, on average, have lagged behind stock and bond indexes for five years in a row. ""We failed to add value, and that was our job,"" Mr. Meyer, 69 years old, said in an interview. ""I would put this pretty high on the 'frustrating period' list."" Convexity's assets under management stand at $10.9 billion, down about one-quarter from the $14.8 billion the firm oversaw in early 2013. Convexity pursues a complex fixed-income strategy that seeks to take advantage of securities prices it believes are out of sync with one another. But with interest rates at historic lows and markets placid until relatively recently, Mr. Meyer said he found himself stymied. ""The Fed had rates pretty well locked up, and they spent trillions of dollars to keep things exactly where they wanted,"" Mr. Meyer said. ""We are often able to overcome that--particularly when there's some choppiness in the market--but during this two-year period we weren't."" Other hedge-fund managers including Paul Tudor Jones have expressed similar frustration with the global economic environment. However, some observers are growing impatient with that defense. ""Suddenly it's everyone else's fault,"" said Brian Shapiro, founder of hedge-fund analytics company Simplify LLC. ""It's a form of capitulation. You either produce uncorrelated returns, or you don't."" In an unusual approach, Convexity reports performance to investors in terms of whether it has beaten or underperformed market benchmarks. That means that even when the firm says it is in the red, investors may have made money--just not as much as a passive investment that mimics a benchmark. By the firm's own metrics, Convexity has fallen short of benchmarks by 2.4, 3.7 and 0.3 percentage points in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, the documents show. Since inception, Convexity has beaten benchmarks by an average of 3.73 percentage points a year. Some investors are starting to lower their expectations for hedge funds overall. Deutsche Bank AG released a survey this week that found only 14% of wealthy investors foresee double-digit returns from hedge funds, down from 37% a year earlier and 57% in 2010. Mr. Meyer gained fame in the 1990s as chief investment officer of Harvard Management Co. He chalked up above-average returns at Harvard's endowment by being among the first to embrace so-called alternative investments outside of traditional stocks and bonds. He also attracted criticism from some alumni for paying employees lavishly--in a few cases more than $30 million a year. He defended the practice as necessary to retain top employees. Harvard's endowment grew from about $5 billion when he took over in 1990 to more than $22 billion when he stepped down in 2005. Mr. Meyer left Harvard to start his own firm, which he named Convexity after an academic descriptor for fixed-income risk. He set up new offices near the top of Boston's John Hancock tower, the city's tallest, and raised more than $6 billion for the launch. Harvard's endowment itself, then managed by Mohamed El-Erian, invested $500 million in Mr. Meyer's new enterprise in 2006. Lately, Mr. Meyer has partly shifted tack. He reduced his use of leverage, or borrowed money, and cut back on trades on interest-rate movements, investor documents indicate. The firm reported positive relative performance in the final quarter of 2014 and is up by about an additional 0.60 percentage point in 2015. At one point last year, Mr. Meyer quoted the classic-rock band the Doors in an investor letter: ""Been down so long it looks like up to me,"" he wrote. ""The bleeding has stopped,"" he said in the interview. ""We're feeling better now. We have a handle on this.""

On tap for 2015, I learned, is a major nationwide rollout of teaching clinics under the rubric of its popular ""Golf Channel Academy"" program. The annual show, which began in 1954, is mostly forward looking but always also includes analytics about the year just ended. Rounds played in 2014 were essentially flat, according to preliminary PGA PerformanceTrak stats released during the show. Rounds overall were down 1.4% compared with 2013 but adjusted for weather (rounds played per day open) they were up 1%.

""The industry is stabilizing but not booming,"" summarized Jim Koppenhaver, the principal at Pellucid, a golf-consulting firm. The bright spot is avid golfers, who are playing as much as ever. The weak spots are fringe players and millennials, contributing to a net loss of between 600,000 and 1 million players last year, according to Pellucid. The Hack Golf initiative, introduced with fanfare at last year's merchandise show to broaden golf's appeal, wasn't much in evidence this year. But foot golf--kicking soccer balls around a course into special, appropriately-sized holes--has proved mildly popular, enough to spawn a dispute between two would-be rules-making bodies.

Most big manufacturers have introduced so-called counter-balanced putters. They are generally longer than standard putters, with 50 grams or more added to the head and another 50 grams or more of weight added to the top of the grip, above where the player is intended the hold the club. Anchoring the butt end of the putter to the chest, soon to be illegal, restricts ""freedom of motion"" and stabilizes the stroke, said Benoit Vincent, TaylorMade's chief technical officer. ""If you add mass in the same area where the player anchored, it provides much of the same benefit."" Another approach is to facilitate ""locking"" the putter shaft to the left, or leading, forearm during the stroke, similar to Matt Kuchar's putting method. The AccuLock Ace putter from BioMech Golf accomplishes this by attaching a long shaft at the rear of a big putter head. The shaft leans forward dramatically, allowing it to nestle comfortably along the inside of the left forearm. The other big equipment trend is clubs with slots, for faster speed and more consistency, in both irons and woods. Even Titleist, the most traditional of clubmakers, debuted its first-ever ""active recoil channel"" in the sole of its new 915 driver. Whereas previously in club design the backside was used mostly just as mass, channels are flexible parts that can help woods generate higher ball-speed and lower spin, both crucial for distance. They also reduce the negative impact of mis-hitting the ball low on the clubface, a traditional dead zone. Clubmakers over the years have maximized launch conditions for balls hit in the middle part of the clubface. ""But the edges have stayed where they were, so there can actually be more inconsistency now between center shots and shots hit away from the center,"" Vincent said. For most of TaylorMade's new irons, that means horizontal slots along the bottom of the clubface and vertical slots on the heel and toe. Other clubmakers are pursuing similar strategies. Among other new products that caught my eye are Ben Hogan irons, in a revival of that iconic brand; new ProV1 and ProV1x balls, which the company says are softer and Watson says perform better in the wind; an avalanche of snazzy new pushcarts that fold up quickly into lightweight cubes (here's hoping that trend continues); and a GPS round-tracking system called Arccos that automatically uploads every shot and the club used into the cloud, with virtually no input required by the golfer.

Doc_75,The Future of Medicine Is in Your Smartphone; New tools are tilting health-care control from doctors to patients,"Topol, Eric J","[...]except for ICUs, operating rooms and emergency rooms, hospitals of the future are likely to be roomless data surveillance centers for remote patient monitoring. Other wearable sensor tools now being developed include necklaces that can monitor your heart function and check the amount of fluid in your lungs, contact lenses that can track your glucose levels or your eye pressure (to help manage glaucoma), and head bands that can capture your brain waves.\n","Over the past decade, smartphones have radically changed many aspects of our everyday lives, from banking to shopping to entertainment. Medicine is next. With innovative digital technologies, cloud computing and machine learning, the medicalized smartphone is going to upend every aspect of health care. And the end result will be that you, the patient, are about to take center stage for the first time. With the smartphone revolution, an increasingly powerful new set of tools--from attachments that can diagnose an ear infection or track heart rhythms to an app that can monitor mental health--can reduce our use of doctors, cut costs, speed up the pace of care and give more power to patients. Digital avatars won't replace physicians: You will still be seeing doctors, but the relationship will ultimately be radically altered. (I consult for several companies on many of the issues discussed here.) All of this raises serious issues about hacking and personal privacy that haven't yet been addressed--and the accuracy of all of these tools needs to be tested. People are also right to worry that the patient-doctor relationship could be eroded, diminishing the human touch in medicine. But the transformation is already under way. Let's say you have a rash that you need examined. Today, you can snap a picture of it with your smartphone and download an app to process the image. Within minutes, a dedicated computer algorithm can text you your diagnosis. That message could include next steps, such as recommending a topical ointment or a visit to a dermatologist for further assessment. Smartphones already can be used to take blood-pressure readings or even do an electrocardiogram. ECG apps have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for consumers and validated in many clinical studies. The apps' data are immediately analyzed, graphed, displayed on-screen updated with new measurements, stored and (at an individual's discretion) shared. I thought I'd seen it all in my decadeslong practice as a cardiologist, but recently, for the first time, I had an ECG emailed to me by a patient, with the subject line, ""I'm in atrial fib, now what do I do?"" I immediately knew that the world had changed. The patient's phone hadn't just recorded the data; it had interpreted it. Now, at any time of day or night, you can demand and get a secure video consultation with a doctor via smartphone at the same cost (about $30-$40) as the typical copay charge through employer health plans. This may seem exotic now, but several large consulting firms--including Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers--have forecast that virtual physician visits (replacing physical office visits) will soon become the norm. Deloitte says that as many as one in six doctor visits were already virtual in 2014. In many U.S. cities, you can even use a mobile app to request a doctor's house call during which a physician would not only provide a consultation but could even perform procedures, such as suturing a wound, which would have usually required an expensive emergency room visit. Many surveys show that most consumers want to get information about the actual costs of their care from their doctors but can't get it. Going forward, what things cost will no longer be the great unmentionable hanging over medicine: Cost-transparency apps for your smartphone already exist and are quickly being expanded to cover lab tests, scans, procedures, hospitals and doctor visits. Even bigger changes are in the works. Using wearable wireless sensors, you can use your smartphone to generate your own medical data, including measuring your blood-oxygen and glucose levels, blood pressure and heart rhythm. And if you're worried that your child may have an ear infection, a smartphone attachment will let you perform an easy eardrum exam that can rapidly diagnose the problem without a trip to the pediatrician. These innovations are just the start. In the next year or two (depending on approval by the FDA), many Americans will probably start sporting wristwatches that continuously and passively capture their blood pressure and vital signs with every heartbeat, without even having to press a start button. Such wristwatch sensors could do enormous good. By having the equivalent of intensive care unit monitoring on your wrist, hospital rooms--those $4,500-a-night risk zones for serious infections and other complications--can be replaced by our bedrooms. As a result, except for ICUs, operating rooms and emergency rooms, hospitals of the future are likely to be roomless data surveillance centers for remote patient monitoring. Other wearable sensor tools now being developed include necklaces that can monitor your heart function and check the amount of fluid in your lungs, contact lenses that can track your glucose levels or your eye pressure (to help manage glaucoma), and head bands that can capture your brain waves. Someday, socks and shoes might analyze the human gait to, for instance, tell a Parkinson's patient whether his or her medications are working or tell a caregiver whether an elderly family member is unsteady and at risk of falling. We know that our health is highly influenced by our environment, which has been difficult to quantify. But smartphone sensors under development will be able to monitor your exposure to radiation, air pollution or pesticides in foods. And your medications could soon be digitized to provide you with reminders to ensure that you've taken them as prescribed. It isn't just hospitals' rooms that are on their way out; so are their labs. Smartphone attachments will soon enable you to perform an array of routine lab tests via your phone. Blood electrolytes; liver, kidney and thyroid function; analysis of breath, sweat and urine--all can be checked with small fluid samples in little labs that plug directly into smartphones. And you can do your own routine labs at a fraction of the current cost. Smartphone selfies are all the rage, but smartphone physical exams are just taking off. The ability to make a definitive DIY diagnosis of an ear infection with a phone is just the first step. Apps are now being developed to handle all aspects of the eye, the throat and oral cavity, and the lungs and heart. Meanwhile, nearly all sophisticated medical imaging devices are being miniaturized: Hand-held ultrasound devices are already available, and some medical schools have begun issuing them in the place of the old-school stethoscope. Hand-held MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machines aren't far behind, and engineers at UCLA have come up with a smartphone-sized device that can generate X-rays. It won't be long before you can take a smartphone X-ray selfie if you're worried that you might have broken a bone. In the next decade, you--under select circumstances, involving high risk or major medical need--will be able to monitor almost every organ system, no matter how difficult to access, as firms start to produce nanosensors to be embedded in your bloodstream. These microscopic sensors within your body can float in blood or be fixed to a microstent in a tiny blood vessel. You'll then be able to keep your blood under constant surveillance for the first appearance of cancer, autoimmune attacks on vital tissues or the tiny cracks in artery walls that can lead to heart attacks or strokes. With all these new tools, it is no surprise that we're talking about the possibility of ""doctorless"" medicine. Let's not get too carried away. You'll still be seeing doctors--but you'll have a lot more control. That change is badly overdue. Medicine has long been dominated by a priestly class, beginning with Imhotep, the first physician (and a priest), in Egypt some 4,600 years ago. Things had hardly changed two millennia later when Hippocrates, widely considered the father of medicine, held that most medical information should be concealed from patients. Hippocrates's paternalistic sentiments survive today in our culture's pervasive sense that ""doctor knows best."" Physicians obviously tend to think so, but that sentiment is also powerfully reinforced by the top-down way medical information flows (or clogs). The vast majority of doctors are unwilling to email patients or share their office notes. Getting a copy of a report after lab tests or medical scans seems impossible--and don't even think about getting the results or images themselves. That is all about to change. We're often told that the U.S. faces a big looming shortage of physicians. The expansion of DIY medical capabilities certainly challenges that notion: We may end up not having a physician shortage at all. But one discipline already has an unequivocal dearth of health-care professionals: mental health, which is also the leading cause of disability in the U.S. and many other developed countries. Smartphones can be particularly helpful here. New apps aim to quantify your state of mind by a composite of real-time data: tone and inflection of voice, facial expression, breathing pattern, heart rate, galvanic skin response, blood pressure, even the frequency and content of your emails and texts. We may soon take an even bigger step forward, thanks to the unexpected advantages of virtual psychiatrists. Recent studies, including a paper by Gale Lucas and others published last year in the Journal of Computers in Human Behavior, have demonstrated that people are more willing to disclose their inner thoughts to a computer avatar or ""virtual human"" than a real one. With machines working to quantify moods and even offering virtual counseling to help make up for our current profound shortage of mental health professionals, we can glimpse a new approach to improving mental health. This is heady stuff--but this vision of medicine also raises some serious and reasonable concerns. Before these tools enter widespread use, they must all be validated through clinical trials and shown to not only preserve health but to do so while lowering costs. Without such validation, the whole promise of digital medicine will be for naught. Moreover, while we may find cases in which it is easier to tell things to a digital avatar, we can't rely on avatars as doctors, powered by DIY physical exams and lab tests alone. These new high-tech tools can provide useful medical information directly, quickly and inexpensively to consumers. But physical visits with doctors will never be replaced for important, serious matters that require face-to-face conversations--and no keyboards. Even as we're making great strides in capturing personal medical information, we're way behind in dealing with the data deluge. We've done far too little to protect our precious personal health data's privacy, stop it from being sold to third parties or secure it from hacking. We're also pathetic at data analytics: We tend to hoard big data and have done relatively little to extract meaningful information from it. To make matters even more complicated, none of the new patient-generated data--from sensors, lab tests, self-exams, DNA sequencing or auto-imaging--is flowing into the traditional hospital- or doctor-owned electronic health records. I think all these problems can be managed, but it will take work. And these obstacles shouldn't dissuade us from seizing the progress that is at hand. The real revolution doesn't come from having your own secure, in-depth medical data warehouse on your smartphone. It comes from the cloud, where we can combine all our individual data. When that flood of data is properly assembled, integrated and analyzed, it will offer huge new potential at two levels--the individual and the population as a whole. Once all our relevant data are tracked and machine-processed to spot the complex trends and interactions that no one could detect alone, we'll be able to pre-empt many illnesses. Take asthma attacks. A teenager who's prone to wheezing in gym class could get comprehensive data on environmental exposures such as air quality and pollen count, along with data on physical activity, oxygen concentration in the blood, vital signs and chest motion; their lung function can be assessed through their smartphone microphone, and their nitric-oxide levels can be sampled via their breath. Then that information could be combined with the data from every other tracked asthma patient--and trigger a warning, delivered by text or voice message on the teenager's phone, that an attack is imminent and tell the teenager which inhaler would prevent it. The same type of procedure could prevent heart failure, seizures, severe depression and autoimmune disease attacks. It could save countless lives. Finally, we simply cannot imagine what we'll learn from the brave new world of open medicine: massive online information resources that pull together data from millions and eventually billions of individuals. Think of Facebook's ability to obtain social data from more than a billion people--but now imagine pulling together medical information never previously aggregated or even acquired. A person who develops a new illness could use an open-medicine resource to find their nearest ""neighbor""--the individual who most closely resembles their condition--to help determine the best treatment. Putting hundreds of sensors into cars and providing exquisite computer navigational support didn't just produce autonomous cars; it also made them safer than old-school, lower-tech cars driven by humans. The same combination of sensors and computing power is about to do something similar to medicine--transforming it from a weakly evidence-based practice to a data science, with empowered individuals at center stage. As more medical data is generated by patients and processed by computers, much of medicine's diagnostic and monitoring aspects will shift away from physicians like me. The ""doctorless"" patient will remain in charge, turning to doctors chiefly for treatment, guidance, wisdom, experience, empathy and the human touch. These doctors won't write orders; they'll offer advice. Just as the printing press democratized information, the medicalized smartphone will democratize health care. Anywhere you can get a mobile signal, you'll have new ways to practice data-driven medicine. Patients won't just be empowered; they'll be emancipated.

Doc_76,"Get Pumped for Super Bowl XLIX; A guide to watching the game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks for beginner, intermediate and expert fans","Futterman, Matthew",None available.,"Phoenix Sunday's Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots pits one of the league's top defenses against one of its most prolific offenses in a can't-miss showdown likely to be decided by a crucial possession late in the game. Has the National Football League ever needed a great game so desperately? The season began with an investigation into how the NFL bungled its probe of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice's assault of his then-fiancê©e in an Atlantic City hotel elevator. It's now stumbling toward its climax under the shroud of another investigation. Commissioner Roger Goodell--and millions of fans--want to know how 11 of the 12 balls the Patriots used in the cold rain of the AFC Championship Game two weeks ago were slightly deflated before the opening kickoff. That likely made it easier for quarterback Tom Brady and the Patriots offense to grip the ball as they obliterated the Indianapolis Colts 45-7. The Patriots have denied any wrongdoing, and owner Robert Kraft this week demanded an apology from the NFL if the team isn't proved guilty. The Patriots aren't getting disqualified, though they will likely face fines and lose draft picks if investigators find evidence they intentionally violated a rule. This much we know: The balls Sunday will be pumped to specifications, and a championship game will be played. Football fans can be thankful for that. This Super Bowl presents a near-perfect portrait of the evolving NFL, where everything is in flux--from the size of the players and the skill sets that their positions require, to shifts in the positions themselves. The names of the positions haven't changed but the jobs often bear little resemblance to what they once were. NFL coaches, especially Bill Belichick of the Patriots and Pete Carroll of the defending champion Seahawks, try to find the roles that best suit their personnel rather than trying to get a player to meet the predetermined job requirements of a certain position. ""Within each team there are unique guys,"" said Dan Quinn, the Seahawks defensive coordinator and the hottest head-coach prospect on the market this off-season. ""It is just about featuring the guys and the roles they can do best."" Here is a guide to watching the game for beginner, intermediate and expert fans. Each level focuses on a different position. The positions tell the story about how NFL football becomes an ever-faster, more pass-obsessed game that Vince Lombardi, the legendary Packers coach for whom the championship trophy is named, might barely recognize, and where change is the only constant. Beginner: QBs Keep it simple. Keep the eyes trained on the quarterbacks. The Patriots' Tom Brady is the quarterback from central casting, a classic 6-foot-4-inch drop-back passer, with the perfect jawline, runway-ready hair and the supermodel wife (Gisele Bê_ndchen). His counterpart, the Seahawks' Russell Wilson, has become the quintessential modern field general. Wilson may be 5 inches shorter than Brady, but he is very athletic, he averaged 7.2 yards every time he ran the ball this season, and was his team's second-leading rusher. Alan Branch, the Patriots defensive lineman who played for the Seahawks in 2011-12, said when he entered the league in 2007 quarterbacks weren't nearly as athletic as Wilson. Now, he says, teams demand that their quarterbacks be able to do far more than make pretty throws. ""You got to be able to extend the plays and get those extra yards,"" he said. ""It's now the age of football where you could get run over by a quarterback."" Wilson, who is 26, passed for 3,475 yards this season and gained 849 yards on the ground. Sixteen teams didn't have a running back who could rush as effectively. Wilson is a master at hiding his intentions until the last possible moment. Defenses never know what Wilson is going to do even when he drops back into what looks like a pass. ""He's like a jitterbug,"" Branch said of Wilson. The Seahawks run certain plays in which Wilson doesn't know what he is going to do when the ball gets snapped. Such plays allow him to decide on the fly whether to hand the ball off, run it himself or pass. Wilson dropped back 546 times this season, but only threw the ball 452 times, or 83% of the time. By contrast, Brady threw the ball on all but 30 of the 613 plays when he dropped back this season, or 95%. Brady ran the ball 36 times this season for 57 yards, though one gain accounted for 17 of those yards. Eliminate that run and he averages only just slightly better than one yard per rush. ""We wanted our quarterback to be like a point guard and distribute the ball,"" Carroll said of Wilson, finding rare common ground between football and basketball. ""He's just getting started."" Brady, who is 37, is winding up his 15th season. In the twilight of his career, he can still be frighteningly effective, completing 66% of his passes in the playoffs compared with 57% for Wilson. On average he gets rid of the ball in just 2.4 seconds, according to Pro Football Focus, an advanced analytics company, compared with 3.2 seconds for Wilson, the longest average in the NFL. ""As a pass rusher, you know where [Brady] is going to be,"" said Cliff Avril, the Seahawks defensive end. ""But then he gets rid of it pretty quickly so it can be pretty frustrating."" Intermediate: Tight Ends Once upon a time the name of the position ""tight end"" was a pretty accurate description of that role. The tight end lined up to the immediate right or left of the offensive line: He was on the end of the line and in tight with the rest of the blocking crew. Sometimes he helped the line with its primary goals of protecting the quarterback or clearing a path for a running back. Sometimes he threw a quick block and headed downfield to become an extra target for a passing quarterback. Sometimes he ditched blocking altogether and just joined the receivers right after the center snapped the ball to the quarterback. Regardless, the tight end usually started the play in the same spot. His dual role as a blocker and a potential receiver required that he be bigger than he was fast and that his hands have a deep-tissue masseur's strength rather than an eye surgeon's touch. In other words, he had little in common with the Patriots' Rob Gronkowski or the Seahawks' Luke Willson. Gronkowski's and Willson's predecessors played in an NFL where offenses ran the ball on nearly 60% of all plays. But with the emergence of the short passing game in the 1980s, coaches realized that quick passes were a far more effective way of moving the ball. This season NFL teams ran the ball on just 44% of plays. Now the tight end has become a primary offensive weapon whose whereabouts change so much it requires countless hours of memorization to figure out where to be on every play. ""You got to study up every day,"" Gronkowski said. ""It takes a while."" Gronkowski is 6-feet-7 inches tall, 260 pounds, and has returned from a half-dozen surgeries (back, knee, arm) in recent years, seemingly unscathed. He runs the 40-yard dash in 4.7 seconds, can change direction on a dime and had 82 receptions this season. He can bowl defenders over one minute then exhibit the grace of a ballet dancer the next. ""We got to know where that guy is on every play,"" said Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright. Tracking Gronkowski or Willson is harder than it sounds. Gronkowski played 987 snaps this season. He lined up in the traditional tight-end position less than one-third of the time. He lined up as a wide receiver 142 times and as a fullback 11 times. Willson is more predictable, lining up as a traditional tight end on 61% of his 684 snaps, but he was a wide receiver on 79 snaps and a fullback 11 times. Willson, who is in just his second year, was smart enough to survive Rice University. ""That certainly helps,"" Willson said. ""As a rookie I studied a lot. Once you get the hang of it, it becomes a little easier."" Willson and Gronkowski exemplify what the tight end is now and what it will likely be for the foreseeable future, or at least until defenses figure out how to apply enough pressure on the quarterback that the tight end has to revert to blocking pass-rushers instead of catching touchdowns. (Tight ends will not be happy about this.) For now though, having a tight end like Gronkowski or Willson is kryptonite for NFL defenses. It's not a coincidence that each of the teams has one. Gronkowski's location early in the game may indicate how confident Belichick feels about his offensive line's ability to protect Brady and create space for the running back, Blount. The closer Gronkowski is to the wide receivers, the better Belichick feels about the Patriots' ability to match up physically against the NFL's top defense. If he is in tight to the line, Belichick is admitting weakness. If Gronkowski is jumping around and constantly in motion, Belichick is essentially saying he needs to gimmick his way to a victory. Bobby Wagner, the Seahawks' linebacker, said there is only one way to stop a player like Gronkowski from doing lethal damage. ""You try to make sure your hand is in front of the ball when he is trying to catch it,"" he said. Expert: Linebackers The hardest thing to do when watching a football game is to not watch the ball, but watching the linebackers will tell plenty about what is happening in the NFL in 2015 and how these teams approach defense. Time was linebackers were the big, nasty lugs who made their living rushing and beating on quarterbacks with their blitzes. In the era of the pass, when quarterbacks have gotten so good at using tight ends like Gronkowski to avoid the blitz, the pure linebackers on these two premier teams rarely rush the passer. Instead, both teams designate one linebacker to rush the passer on roughly half the plays, while the other ones either drop back into pass coverage or try to guard against a running back who breaks through the first line of defense. They are getting smaller and faster than they once were, rarely weighing much more than 250 pounds, and in this game they are actually on par with the size of the running backs they will have to stop. Consider Jamie Collins, the Patriots outside linebacker. Collins played defensive back in college at Southern Mississippi. He is listed at 250 pounds, but looks smaller than that. His speed and experience as a defensive back make him ideal for a modern linebacker. He played 942 plays this year and rushed the quarterback just 85 times. Seahawks linebackers K.J. Wright, Bobby Wagner and Bruce Irvin played 2,319 snaps this season and rushed the quarterback just 18% of the time. Smaller linebackers have wrought bigger running backs, who can expose the middle of a defense's vulnerabilities. ""I don't feel like any linebacker is going to be able to take a big hit on me unless they get me in the backfield,"" said Blount, who weighs 250 pounds. ""I don't know that anyone wants to take me on one-on-one. I definitely make it a most difficult task."" Meanwhile, Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch may be the hardest running back to tackle in football. ""He's a very physical player and he keeps his feet moving,"" said Chandler Jones, the Patriots defensive lineman, who sometimes lines up as a linebacker. Seattle's linebackers enter the game with one big advantage. Since Brady is largely immobile they don't have to use one of their linebackers as a ""spy"" whose main responsibility is to watch a quarterback who loves to run, as Wilson does, and chase him down when he breaks out of the backfield. ""That plays right into our hands,"" said Wright, the Seahawks linebacker. How they use what will feel like having an extra player on the field will illustrate where Carroll, the Seahawks' head coach, believes his team is most vulnerable. Will they shadow Gronkowski, wherever he moves? Will someone be assigned to act as a sort of ""spy"" on Blount? Seattle's defensive backs Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor get most of the attention, but Quinn, the team's defensive coordinator, said the success of the unit often rides on the versatility of men in the middle of the field. ""For us, it is really we've got terrific linebackers who've got great speed,"" he said.

[...]depending on whether a male or female is browsing, a search for ""workouts"" generates fitness tips that are as different as the pages of ""Men's Fitness"" and ""Women's Health.\n","Pinterest Inc. hit the demographic jackpot after it launched four years ago, becoming the digital scrapbook du jour for blushing brides, arts and crafts enthusiasts and home decorators hunting for ideas and inspiration. About 42% of online U.S. women use Pinterest, according to a Pew Research survey released this month, a coveted audience with enormous spending power. Among its social peers, only Facebook Inc.'s site boasts a higher percentage of the online U.S. female audience. But Pinterest's success with women has also created a conundrum for the business. The company has outsize aspirations to become the go-to place for discovery on the Web. And yet the other half of the world's population has largely stayed away from the site in part because of the stigma that Pinterest is a clubhouse for women. ""We're really trying to unpack and understand that so we can communicate to [men] that Pinterest is absolutely for you,"" said David Rubin, who joined as head of marketing in July from Unilever PLC, where he worked on women's beauty and helped launch the Axe men's deodorant brand. The same Pew survey showed that just 13% of online men in the U.S. use Pinterest, up from 8% a year earlier. Digital analytics firm comScore estimates that about 71% of the site's 72.5 million visitors in December were women, making it the most female-skewed social platform. The male experience on Pinterest has been similar to visiting a women's department store. Now Pinterest is trying to make it easier for them to find the men's section. The stakes are high. This month, Pinterest began selling ads to marketers for the first time. Venture capitalists valued Pinterest at $5 billion last year despite little to no revenue on the belief it can compete with the likes of Facebook, Google Inc. and Twitter Inc. for advertising dollars. Marketers such as Target Corp. have generally been intrigued by Pinterest's potential. Users post, or ""pin,"" images they find on the Internet to self-created photo galleries, or ""boards."" So far they have pinned over 30 billion unique entries, revealing to marketers valuable information about what they might be interested in buying. Pinterest's new ad, called a ""promoted pin,"" targets specific users based on their interests, location or searches. The ads show up in search results or when users tap on a category of pins. The San Francisco company's executives like to say, ""We want to do for discovery what Google did for search."" In other words, when someone wants to embark on a home improvement project or peruse easy-to-make dinner recipes, Pinterest wants them to search for ideas on its site. But men aren't exactly doing the searching, meaning that Pinterest is potentially missing out on a large chunk of advertising. Pinterest executives say the gender imbalance stems from its origins. Initially pitched by founders Ben Silbermann, the CEO, and Evan Sharp, its head of design, as a tool to easily collect or ""scrapbook"" images from around the Web, Pinterest inadvertently became a woman's world. Its original users in the arts and crafts community spread to mommy bloggers, home decorators and avid cooks. Soon, it was the hot place to be for magazine brands like ""Elle"" and ""Real Simple."" ""I think the stereotype of it as a female space is probably not helpful when you're trying to attract men,"" said Robert Kozinets, a professor of marketing at York University's business school in Toronto. ""It's more stigmatizing for a man to be on a woman's site than the reverse. The perception is that it weakens a man's social standing."" Part of the solution is to make it easier for men to discover what they are interested in. Pinterest executives say they are focused on making the site more ""gender neutral."" Some of the most popular topics on Pinterest, such as cooking, gardening and travel, interest both men and women. So the company says it has made subtle changes, such as serving up more tacos and pizzas alongside its popular baked goods and family meals when users are searching for recipe ideas; or showing a range of costumes on Halloween, from single women in the cities to Dads in the suburbs. ""It will take some time, but it's about trying to show this as a bigger tent--as a utility that works for a lot of people,"" Mr. Rubin said. Pinterest has also modified the sign-up process so that the list of suggested interests the site recommends users follow is generated based on gender. More recently, Pinterest rolled out personalized search results where gender is factored into the results. For instance, depending on whether a male or female is browsing, a search for ""workouts"" generates fitness tips that are as different as the pages of ""Men's Fitness"" and ""Women's Health."" In the past, the results for male users would have included a mix of men's and women's workout regimens. Pinterest says this feature, now available to all of its users, has led to increased engagement on the platform. Indeed, male users spent 1.59 billion minutes on the site in December, more than four times as much as a year earlier, according to comScore. Meanwhile, women spent 4.94 billion minutes, up 42% from the prior year. The number of pins added to Pinterest's content library associated with male-oriented categories has also grown. Over the past year pins for ""geek"" content grew 175%, ""cars and motorcycles"" increased 134% and ""men's fashion"" jumped 122%. Pinterest declined to provide user numbers, but says male user ranks grew 54% in the six months through November, outpacing the rate of female sign-ups. The company has also made sure its content is of interest to both genders when it launches in international markets. As a result, the user base is more of an even split in markets such as Korea, India and Japan, according to Pinterest, which is available in over 30 languages. ""It gives me a lot of confidence that over time even the U.S. may go to a much more balanced distribution,"" said Tim Kendall, Pinterest's head of product. Regardless of the content, the gender divide may be rooted more deeply in the site's grid-like design, says Joan Meyers-Levy, a marketing professor at the University of Minnesota who specializes in gender differences in information processing. Ms. Meyers-Levy's studies have shown that women are able to process information more comprehensively and to do so at a lower threshold. Men are more selective and tend to focus on the essentials. In other words, Pinterest's busy design may create an information-overload for men. ""If this was a magazine, they'd turn the page,"" Ms. Meyers-Levy said. ""It works for females because they like detail, they like more complexity."" In response, a Pinterest spokeswoman pointed out that the product and site were designed by three men . Co-founder Paul Sciarra left the company in 2012. No matter the reasons, Pinterest likely faces a lengthy struggle to reel in more men like Nicholas Hardesty, an avid user since 2012 with over 35 boards and thousands of pins on subjects such as breakfast foods and the movie ""Star Wars."" The 34-year-old director of religious education in Owensboro, Ky., says he likes collecting things and organizing them in one place, but his male friends have largely stayed away. ""They don't make fun of me per se,"" Mr. Hardesty said, ""but give me a sideways glance or a little bit of a 'why are you on there?'""

Doc_78,"Mets Try New Trick on Defense: Predicting Where Ball Will Be Hit; Thanks to their slow-footed middle infielders, Mets find themselves on the forefront of a trend sweeping baseball: the science of defensive positioning","Diamond, Jared","Flores, a player best known for his offensive potential, didn't play a single minor-league game at shortstop in 2012 or 2013 because the Mets doubted he could handle the position. When spring training began, Teufel gathered the Mets' infielders in a room and delivered a presentation explaining ""defensive efficiency,"" a team-created statistic designed to measure the Mets' adeptness at turning expected outs into actual outs.","PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.--As the Mets' infield coach, Tim Teufel is responsible for transforming the team's defense into a reinforced wall. Much of the team's fate in 2015 will hinge on the success of its young pitchers, so the significance of making plays behind them cannot be overstated. With that in mind, Teufel spent the winter crunching numbers and studying reams of data provided by the Mets' analytics department. As he read the reports, he kept coming back to the same conclusion. ""Our percentage is really good on balls at us and not too far away from us,"" Teufel said. ""If we can get them in the area, we're going to be a lot more efficient."" In other words, the Mets' middle infielders--shortstop Wilmer Flores and second baseman Daniel Murphy--do fine when the ball is hit right at them. But when a ball forces them to vacate their posts, it often winds up in the outfield. Flores, a player best known for his offensive potential, didn't play a single minor-league game at shortstop in 2012 or 2013 because the Mets doubted he could handle the position. Now they intend to use him there every day, in part because they like his bat, but mostly because they lack another viable option. Meanwhile, since 2012 Murphy ranks 17th of 18 qualified second basemen in ultimate zone rating, a statistic that attempts to quantify how many runs a fielder saves or surrenders on defense. Like Flores, his value is in his hitting, not his glove-work. If Flores and Murphy will never develop Gold Glove range, then they'll have to stand where the ball is going to be hit--before it is hit. That puts the Mets on the forefront of a burgeoning trend sweeping baseball: the science of defensive positioning. In this context, positioning doesn't just apply to dramatic infield shifts, an increasingly common practice around the league wherein defenders bunch up on one side of the field. It instead refers to more subtle changes to the traditional defensive alignment. The tweaks may be difficult to spot, but those few steps could make the difference between a hit and an out. ""You're never going to turn everything into a routine play,"" said Ben Jedlovec, the president of Baseball Info Solutions and the co-author of ""The Fielding Bible."" ""If you can take one difficult play for a range-challenged infielder and make it an easier play for him by moving him a couple of steps, that's a net positive."" When spring training began, Teufel gathered the Mets' infielders in a room and delivered a presentation explaining ""defensive efficiency,"" a team-created statistic designed to measure the Mets' adeptness at turning expected outs into actual outs. Defensive efficiency takes into account, among many other factors, the opposing batter, the Mets' pitcher, the count, the base-runner situation--virtually anything that can be evaluated empirically. It goes far beyond basic spray charts and more rudimentary efficiency ratings used on some publicly accessible websites, which only show how often a team turns batted balls into outs. Most of the players don't know how the Mets' defensive efficiency is calculated, but that isn't the point. The idea, the Mets say, is to get the players thinking about themselves as a collective unit working and moving in sync. ""We can do a better job of playing the odds,"" third baseman David Wright said. Using the data, the Mets devised an updated version of what Teufel calls ""macro positioning""--the baseline alignment for right-handed and left-handed hitters. They will then adjust further for each individual batter, often changing the fielders' starting spot for every pitch. Before each game, Teufel supplies his infielders with a detailed scouting report on every hitter in the opposing lineup, illustrating their tendencies on how they approach different pitch types and counts. (Last season, 411 different players had at least one plate appearance against the Mets.) Every conceivable scenario comes with slightly different positioning. ""Some guys, they don't like pulling the curveball. Some guys do,"" Flores said. ""You've just got to know the hitter."" After each pitch, the middle infielders will check the sign from the catcher and then relay the pitch type to the first baseman and third baseman. Everybody then shifts positions, careful to wait until the last moment so as not to tip off the batter. If it sounds complicated, that's because it is. Murphy said that ""things are moving pretty fast out there. Don't tell anyone."" ""We're going to have an area of, OK, this is where we start,"" he said. ""Depending on the pitch, the speed of the pitch, the location of the pitch and what it looks like the hitter's trying to do, we have the freedom to adjust off of that."" In a perfect world, the subtle shifts would overshadow the fact that Flores and Murphy don't cover large swaths of ground. It also emphasizes the importance of basic throwing and catching, since the fielders should theoretically be where they need to be when the ball is hit. ""The new positioning arguably underscores the value of making the routine play,"" General Manager Sandy Alderson said. But can it hide all of the Mets' deficiencies in the field? Bill James, the godfather of advanced statistics in baseball and the senior adviser of baseball operations for the Boston Red Sox, isn't so sure. Shifting and tinkering with positioning undoubtedly helps, but it can't fix everything. ""If you leave areas of the field naked, you kind of need somebody who has the mobility to recover,"" James said via email. The Mets realize this, too. Alderson acknowledged that ""there's still great value in range."" Or, as Murphy put it, ""I think the whole organization understands we can't be everywhere."" They can, however, give themselves the best possible chance to make the most plays. And they don't have much of a choice: The Mets remain committed to Flores and Murphy up the middle, defensive flaws and all. The team scoured the shortstop market over the winter for an upgrade over Flores but decided to stand pat, convinced that Flores's reliable hands and accurate throwing arm made him acceptable. ""To the extent that a guy has everything except range, I think guys like that are playable,"" Alderson said. ""To the extent that a guy can do everything except make the routine play, can't turn the double play, poor arm, they're not playable.""

Doc_79,Quad-Play May Not Be All Square for U.K. Telecoms; High Costs of Winning Customers may Offset Benefits to Operators,"Hua, Thao",None available.,"Quad-play is a telecoms race that could leave U.K. operators running to stand still. BT's agreement to buy wireless carrier EE this month to combine mobile services with its existing TV, Internet and fixed line offerings was heartily welcomed by investors; BT stock is up 16% since the company first announced its interest in a deal . The move will kick-start quad-play in the U.K., where only about 6% of total households currently purchase all four services from one provider, according to Strategy Analytics. The theory is that the discounts needed to win subscribers are then offset by the savings from lower customer churn. European operators have also turned to quad-play to win market share and benefit from the exponential growth in data usage. But so far, the evidence is mixed on whether consumers or operators have more to gain from quad-play. Virgin Media, which began bundling all four services in the U.K. last year, has seen some benefits. The rate of departure among customers with quad-play is about 5% annually, or half that of the subscribers who buy packages of three services. But it's too early to tell whether that lower level of churn is sustainable, especially if BT enters the field armed with much bigger discounts. Quad-play price wars have taken a toll elsewhere. Take Telefê_nica: In October 2012, the incumbent operator launched fixed-mobile bundling in Spain, now one of Europe's most advanced quad-play markets covering about 60% of total households. In 2013, Telefonica's churn rate slightly increased even as heavy customer discounts hit its revenues. In fact, the average revenue per user in Spain fell by 14% in 2013 even though data usage increased by 4%. The U.K. may prove different. Its economy has fared better than Spain since the financial crisis. But one potential setback is that quad-play may increase--rather than decrease--the number of competitors. In Britain currently, four different operators dominate the fixed and mobile markets. But none yet has a sizable position in both. BT's bid for EE promises to upend the competitive landscape by merging the U.K.'s leading fixed and mobile by subscribers. Hutchison Whampoa's 3 Group has responded by announcing exclusive talks to acquire O2 from Telefê_nica, while others are scrambling for alliances. If both deals close, there could be six players remaining--five of which are already positioned to offer quad-play packages. BT's deal with EE will give it the strongest position across both markets. But subscriber growth in the U.K. telecoms sector is expected to be relatively flat. If greater competition results in higher costs to win customers without the benefit of lower churn, quad-play providers could still be left with everything bundled, but nothing gained.

Oracle announced its intent to buy Datalogix on Dec. 22. without disclosing the purchase price. The deal closed on Jan. 23, according to Datalogix's website. An Oracle spokeswoman declined to comment on Wednesday. Datalogix merges data about shoppers' purchases in brick-and-mortar stores with their online habits. It helps marketers target online ads to audiences in narrow categories, going deeper than the standard broad breakdowns by age and gender. Datalogix says it also can show when online display ads result in physical store purchases. According to Oracle, Datalogix analyzes information on more than $2 trillion in consumer spending and has 650 customers, including Ford Motor Co. and Kraft Foods Group Inc., as well as digital-media companies such as Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. Advertisers are increasingly spending money on software to analyze data and make decisions, and big software companies such as Oracle and Salesforce.com Inc. are angling to take a larger part of the market. Oracle has been on a shopping spree recently, buying marketing technology companies such as Responsys Inc. and Blue Kai Inc. last year and Eloqua Inc. in 2013. Before the acquisition, Datalogix had been exploring an initial public offering. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that Datalogix was working with banks including Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays PLC on a potential IPO. The acquisition ends a long saga for Datalogix. Cambridge, Mass.-based venture firm General Catalyst Partners created a startup called Datalogix in 2007. The idea was to use consumer purchasing information to better target online ads. Rob Gierkink, then an entrepreneur in residence at the venture firm, was working on the idea after co-founding and running major U.K. and Canadian loyalty programs. Datalogix was in its very early stages when the recession hit. Companies were cheap, and General Catalyst spearheaded a purchase of a struggling company called NextAction Corp. That company, which had been operating since 2002, was largely focused on supplying marketing information to catalog advertisers. By that time, NextAction had ""defaulted on loans and its venture capital investors had cut their contributions,"" according to Datalogix's website. The General Catalyst-led acquisition was for a purchase price in the eight figures, according to VentureWire archives. NextAction and Datalogix merged and rode a wave of demand for digital marketing know-how and information. Companies like Facebook use Datalogix to show advertisers that their ads are effective. In subsequent years, the company raised new capital. Institutional Venture Partners led a $25 million round in 2013. Jim Breyer, an early backer of Facebook while at Accel Partners, invested in Datalogix in 2014, out of his Breyer Capital, and joined the board. Wellington Management, which invests in publicly traded and private companies, as well as in other assets, led a $45 million round last year. Eric Roza, who ran Datalogix after the merger with NextAction, has joined Oracle and will continue heading up the Datalogix business, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.

Doc_81,"VMware Moves to Grab More of Data-Center Spending; Company Unveils New Software for Computing, Data Storage and Networking","Clark, Don","[...]software helps distribute files among the many disk drives that work in concert with servers in a typical data center--an approach used by Web companies like Google Inc.--as well as managing interactions between servers and separate, dedicated storage systems.","SAN FRANCISCO--VMware Inc. stepped up efforts to strengthen its position in corporate computer rooms, unveiling new software for computing, data storage and networking. The Silicon Valley company used a customer event here to announce a major overhaul of its flagship VSphere software, which performs a function known as server virtualization, a VMware hallmark. Virtualization helps companies hold down hardware spending by running more applications per computer server. VMware on Monday also updated software that helps manage networking and data-storage devices, extending a concept known as the software-defined data center. These products are designed to reduce the need for specialized networking and storage hardware, and to let customers deploy applications more quickly. They can also reduce the need for data storage and networking specialists, saving labor costs. ""You don't need all those people,"" said Glenn O'Donnell, an analyst at Forrester Research. VMware announced a new version of its storage software, called Virtual SAN 6, which the company said delivers more than four times the performance of prior versions. Such software helps distribute files among the many disk drives that work in concert with servers in a typical data center--an approach used by Web companies like Google Inc.--as well as managing interactions between servers and separate, dedicated storage systems. Those capabilities compete with offerings from EMC Corp., which owns about 80% of VMware's stock. For its part, EMC offers storage software that can be used in place of Virtual SAN, noted Patrick Gelsinger, VMware's chief executive. But the two companies continue to find ways to cooperate, even as they work with each other's competitors, Mr. Gelsinger said. EMC management has concluded that it is better to profit from software-defined storage than resist the trend. ""They are embracing this technology disruption in a big way,"" he said in an interview. EMC, which purchased VMware in 2003 and later took it public, has faced recent calls from investor Elliott Management Corp. to spin off VMware entirely. That pressure eased a bit earlier this month following a deal with Elliott that placed two new directors on EMC's board. Asked about the prospects for a spinoff, Mr. Gelsinger said he favored remaining part of EMC. ""We believe this is the right structure,"" he said. ""Being bigger and more stable during a period of great disruption is good."" After heady growth in the early days of virtualization, VMware's efforts to profit from other businesses have produced mixed results. VMware last week reported 2014 net income of $866 million, 13% lower than 2013, while revenue increased 16% to $6.04 billion. The company's challenges include customers' move toward buying less on-site software and shifting data-center tasks to cloud services like Amazon.com Inc.'s web services unit. Mr. Gelsinger has responded by advocating ""hybrid"" clouds, in which customers run some programs in their own premises and others externally using cloud services. The company launched a service of its own called vCloud Air, which will promote online offerings from Google, such as online storage and analytics, in a deal announced last week.

Doc_82,"Samsung, Apple Back in Dead Heat for Global Smartphone Dominance; Earnings Reports Highlight Apple's Resurgence, While Underscoring the Stiff Competition Samsung Faces","Cheng, Jonathan; Min-Jeong, Lee","[...]Samsung has turned its focus to selling low-end smartphones, targeted at consumers who have never owned a handset capable of accessing the Internet, which has led to a decline in its profit margins.","SEOUL--The fortunes of the world's two biggest smartphone makers crossed paths again this week, as contrasting earnings reports from Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. put the two technology giants back in a dead heat for leadership of the global smartphone market. and , released within a day of one another, highlighted thanks to the popularity of its bigger-screen iPhones, while underscoring the , particularly from low-cost rivals in China. Data from Counterpoint Technology Market Research showed Apple overtaking Samsung in smartphone shipments for the last three months of 2014 globally. Apple said that it sold 74.5 million iPhones in the quarter, while Samsung said it sold between 71 million and 76 million smartphones. Strategy Analytics said in a report Thursday that in the quarter amounted to 74.5 million--putting it in a tie with Apple for first place. ""We've seen this happen with Nokia and with Motorola,"" said Tom Kang, a Seoul-based analyst with Counterpoint. ""It's definitely a warning sign."" Samsung, which has seen its market share ravaged by low-cost Chinese handset makers, reported a 64% drop in operating profit from mobile phones on Thursday. Mobile phones, which accounted for 75% of Samsung's overall operating profit in the first quarter of 2014, now chip in just 37% of total earnings, as the South Korean company's smartphone sales sag and its semiconductor business picks up speed. Samsung first overtook Apple as the leading smartphone vendor in 2011 as the South Korean firm rode the success of the first smartphone in its popular Galaxy series. The Galaxy smartphones became the central focus of a bitter legal battle between Samsung and Apple over patents and innovation that has played out over the last four years. The two companies agreed last year to settle the legal case outside the U.S. Since last year, Samsung's leadership has been under assault from companies like upstarts Xiaomi Corp. in China and Micromax in India. Its Galaxy S5 smartphone, which it started selling last spring, was something of a flop with consumers, selling about 40% fewer than expected, according to people familiar with the matter. Samsung is hoping to reassert its leadership with its successor device, which is expected to be called the Galaxy S6, and is set to be announced on the sidelines of an industry trade show scheduled for the beginning of March in Barcelona. The convergence of Apple and Samsung's fortunes comes as more of the world's population adopts smartphones, leaving less room for growth. As a result, Samsung has turned its focus to selling low-end smartphones, targeted at consumers who have never owned a handset capable of accessing the Internet, which has led to a decline in its profit margins. Earlier this month, Samsung released a new smartphone in India that sells for just $92. The phone, called the Samsung Z1, is powered by its homegrown Tizen operating system, an alternative to Google Inc.'s Android. Samsung's mobile operating profit margin during the last three months of the year was just 7.5%, a touch higher than the third quarter's margin of 7.1% but well below the 19.8% margin that Samsung's mobile unit enjoyed as recently as the first quarter of 2014. In contrast, Apple, which has long championed a strategy of targeting premium consumers with its high-end iPhones, saw its gross margin rise to 39.9% in its fiscal first quarter ended December from 37.9% a year earlier. That was largely because of the success of its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which borrowed from Samsung's large-screen smartphone strategy. While the two companies are now neck and neck in smartphone sales, in many ways Samsung and Apple are competing for different consumers, says Mr. Kang of Counterpoint. ""Samsung should not even be trying to compete with Apple -- it's a distraction,"" Mr. Kang argues. In the Android market that Samsung still leads in globally, Mr. Kang argues: ""The majority of those users don't want to spend that much money anymore."" While Samsung's earnings report showed the company continuing to feel the pressure from Apple and other handset makers, the company was also quick to note that the magnitude of its earnings slide is moderating, suggesting that Samsung is finding its footing after three consecutive quarters of sharp year-over-year net profit declines. Samsung said its fourth-quarter profit fell 27% to 5.35 trillion won ($4.9 billion), better than the 49% year-over-year slump in the third quarter. Samsung is also finding a stronger footing in its semiconductor business, which analysts say is likely to boost the company's bottom line this year as the mobile division continues to regroup. A large number of Samsung's next flagship smartphones could come equipped with an internally designed mobile processor, said a person familiar with the matter, unlike previous models that relied heavily on processors from Qualcomm Inc. That change would help Samsung lift its mobile profit--albeit modestly--and boost the chip unit that makes mobile processors, analysts say. Fourth-quarter operating profit fell 36% to 5.3 trillion won on an 11% decline in revenue of 52.7 trillion won, Samsung said. Samsung executives also sounded an upbeat note about its non-memory chip business, which analysts say is likely to have weighed down the company's overall semiconductor performance last year.

Kaisa said late Wednesday in a statement released on the Hong Kong stock exchange that its board is reviewing its debt obligations and ""expects material modifications"" to holders of offshore debt, given the company's overall financial condition. ""Lenders and bondholders should not expect payments of principal and interest according to existing terms."" The announcement sent prices of Kaisa's shares and bonds lower Thursday. Kaisa's bond due 2017 traded at 69 cents on the dollar, down from 76 cents Wednesday. Its Hong Kong-traded shares slid as much as 6% before closing down 1.8%. Kaisa, which is based in the southern city of Shenzhen, has been at the forefront of investor concerns about China's slumping property sector, after the company missed an offshore debt payment last month, spooking markets. Developer Sunac China Holdingsstepped in last week , offering to purchase a 49.25% stake for $4.55 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$587 million) conditional upon the restructuring or refinancing of Kaisa's existing debt. Kaisa's latest announcement is part of an attempt to meet those terms, analysts said. Research house Lucror Analytics said Kaisa is signaling ""a distressed exchange"" for holders of its U.S. dollar bonds that will offer creditors less than the original payment terms to avert a default. In its statement Wednesday, Kaisa said Houlihan Lokey (China)--the advisory firm named in late January to advise on a capital restructuring--will devise a plan ""with consideration of restoring stability."" Kaisa said it will speak with lenders and bondholders as soon as possible and aims to complete potential transactions with them by the end of April. The rearranging of debt is typical when the controlling stake in a company changes hands. Lawyers said that with Sunac behind it, Kaisa has more leverage to discuss new repayment terms and ask for extensions with creditors. ""Sunac came to the rescue of Kaisa, and it is a positive for creditors. But it remains to be seen if the white knight would exploit the situation and put additional pressure on creditors,"" said Bernie Liu, a Shanghai-based lawyer at LLinks Law Office. Ratings firm Standard & Poor's said Kaisa isn't out of trouble yet and still faces default risks. Investors are eyeing Kaisa's two coupon payments that come due mid-March, including $16.1 million due on March 18 and $35.5 million due on March 19 for two tranches of bonds. Kaisa said Monday that it has received demand for repayment from its creditors totaling 28 billion yuan ($4.49 billion), and that several of its bank accounts with a total credit balance of 550 million yuan remain frozen. Creditors, including banks, trust firms and wealth-management firms, have filed a total of 60 applications to freeze Kaisa's assets. Kaisa said Monday it received eight court rulings to freeze some of its assets. Kaisa's troubles first surfaced after authorities in Shenzhen prevented apartments in some of its projects from being sold or transferred late last year. Kaisa said Monday authorities still have yet to explain the reason for the freeze.

Although the company has a 30-day grace period to pay after the due date, missing the deadline would put Kaisa in technical default, analysts say. On Thursday evening, a Kaisa representative said he didn't know whether the company had paid. More than two dozen foreign fund companies ranging from BlackRock Inc. to Fidelity Investments and Lion Global Investors owned Kaisa debt in recent months, according to Thomson Reuters, although it isn't clear how many currently hold the debt. BlackRock and Fidelity declined to comment, while a spokesperson for Lion Global, a Singapore-based fund company, said it has sold its holdings. Several fund managers said that the situation is heightening market fears, making foreign investors wary of Chinese property bonds overall and anxious about whether other seemingly healthy companies in the sector could melt down as well. Kaisa's difficulties, which appear to stem from government intervention in a real-estate company, have added to concern about the risk of investing in Chinese bonds more broadly. ""Within a four-week period, we had this almost collapsing situation in Kaisa's operating profile, which would heighten investors' sensitivity to the sector,"" said Charles Macgregor, Asia head at the credit-research firm Lucror Analytics. A default, if confirmed, would be the more shocking because it was so unexpected, investors say. Kaisa was seen as in good financial shape, with a healthy portfolio of commercial and residential projects, strong sales and solid cash flow that had made its bonds popular with investors. Kaisa's net profit in the first half of 2014--the latest figures available--rose 30% versus the previous year to 1.33 billion yuan ($214 million), with revenue of 6.79 billion yuan. As of June 30, the 16-year-old company, which is listed on the Hong Kong exchange, had cash of 9.38 billion yuan versus short-term debt of 6 billion yuan. But during the space of the past few months, the Shenzhen government has blocked approvals of Kaisa developments and property sales in the city, home to some of its major developments--actions the company said in a Dec. 21 statement could have ""an adverse impact on cash flow."" Kaisa's founder and long-time chairman, Kwok Ying Shing, has quit, along with a number of top executives and board members. Neither the government nor Kaisa executives have offered explanations. On Jan. 1, the developer said it defaulted on a $51.6 million loan from HSBC Holdings PLC, and credit raters Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service have downgraded Kaisa's debt from just below investment grade to ratings that reflect an expected default. Kaisa's bond prices have plunged more than 80% since the end of November, and are now trading at around 33 cents on the dollar. Its stock price has fallen more than 60% to 1.59 Hong Kong dollars over the same period. Trading in the stock has been halted since Dec. 29. Many Chinese property companies are heavily indebted, struggling with a weak housing market and difficulties in raising cash to pay back loans. Worries are mounting over the impact of China's economic slowdown and the rising amount of debt among local government-connected financing vehicles, though recent government efforts to ease funding conditions have relieved some concerns. China has $55.7 billion in offshore property debt, according to Dealogic, a data-tracking company. Kaisa, founded by Mr. Kwok in 1999, seemed to be one of the sector's stronger firms. The company has grown rapidly over the past few years: It employed about 9,500 people as of the middle of last year, up from 2,700 in 2009. In the first 11 months of last year, Kaisa's sales totaled 3.72 billion yuan, double the amount in the same period in 2013. The company was ranked No. 1 in residential-property sales in Shenzhen during the first half of 2014, according to SZHome.com, an industry website. Current and former employees say the company emphasizes efficiency and encourages employees to make simple decisions, such as the approval of subcontractors or expenses, within four hours. Industry insiders say that Kaisa has a reputation for finishing large projects within a year, a pace that is faster than the industry average. In October, however, the Chinese government said a high-ranking Communist Party official who had been associated with Shenzhen's Longgang district, where Kaisa is developing several big projects, had been placed under investigation. State media later said the investigation was related to corruption in real estate. Some Chinese media also reported that Mr. Kwok had been detained or was unreachable, which the company denied. In late November, Kaisa discovered that some sales and construction had been blocked by the Shenzhen government, the company said in a December statement. Later, it found that other approvals and projects had been blocked as well. Authorities in Longgang notified Kaisa in December that it had suspended processing of approvals and applications for all of the company's construction projects in the district, Kaisa said. At one of those projects in Longgang--the Kaisa City Plaza--staff at a sales center containing a grand staircase, marble floors, crystal chandeliers, gold-plated bathroom fixtures and a small projection theater were still showing around prospective buyers on a recent afternoon. As the sound of whirring saws rose from inside the development, employees said Kaisa could finish work on existing structures but could no longer sell property or begin new construction. Outside the complex, some homeowners had gathered looking for information, with one saying she was nervous about her recent purchase of a three-bedroom apartment there. The homeowners said they had received little information from Kaisa about the state of their properties. One woman, who asked to be identified only by her surname, Ye, said she had bought property from Kaisa two years ago, and is confident the current problems will be resolved.

Doc_86,"TruAmerica Makes Bet on Upgrading Southern California Apartments; $482 Million Deal for 'Class-B' Buildings That Will Be Spruced Up, Priced Higher","Taves, Max","Since it was founded 18 months ago, TruAmerica Multifamily, majority-owned by Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, has spent $1.42 billion buying up apartment buildings throughout the West. Most major apartment buyers, especially those backed by deep-pocketed institutional investors, have snapped up so-called Class-A, or luxury, properties in prime locations, but TruAmerica is gobbling up Class-B properties, older buildings with fewer amenities that are located in less-fashionable locations.","Since it was founded 18 months ago, TruAmerica Multifamily, majority-owned by Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, has spent $1.42 billion buying up apartment buildings throughout the West. Last week, the company closed on its biggest deal yet: the $482 million acquisition of 14 apartment buildings scattered across Southern California. The buying and selling of multifamily properties has been one of the most active areas in commercial real estate in recent years. But TruAmerica's buying spree stands out. Not only is the company voracious--it has purchased 7,352 apartments and manages another 8,496 in cities from Seattle to Phoenix and Denver, making it among the largest apartment owners in the West--but the company's strategy is slightly unorthodox. Most major apartment buyers, especially those backed by deep-pocketed institutional investors, have snapped up so-called Class-A, or luxury, properties in prime locations, but TruAmerica is gobbling up Class-B properties, older buildings with fewer amenities that are located in less-fashionable locations. The company says its strategy is to buy lower-grade buildings, renovate the units and ""reposition"" the properties as slightly more modern and higher-end in hopes of charging higher rents. The company estimates it will be able to raise rents an average of 6.4% a year, about 1.4 percentage points higher than it expects average rents to rise in Southern California submarkets. That approach makes the Class-B apartment sector ""more attractive because we see there's more room for rent growth,"" says Bob O'Rourke, senior managing director and head of real-estate investment for Guardian Life, which owns 80% of TruAmerica. Like most of its previous acquisitions, TruAmerica's newest assets in Southern California were built in the 1980s. The 2,669 units in the region are spread out in lower middle-class neighborhoods, such as San Pedro and Santa Clarita in Los Angeles County, El Cajon in San Diego and Ontario and Riverside in the Inland Empire. TruAmerica says it plans to invest approximately $40 million in upgrades, including the installation of new cabinets, new floors and, in some locations, modern fitness centers and common areas. Those improvements will ""make it a more Class-A feel,"" says TruAmerica Chief Executive Robert Hart, who holds a 20% stake in the company. Mr. Hart previously was president of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings Inc.'s multifamily management group. The company's strategy isn't without risks. While many real-estate assets were hit by the downturn, value-add deals were particularly hard-hit. Buying up cheap properties and then raising rents after upgrades proved especially challenging when paychecks were shrinking and tenants were downsizing. Class-B buildings ""exist to fill Class-B demand,"" says Brian Kerschner, a senior real-estate economist at data firm CoStar Group. ""This is a situation where you [could] end up converting many of these buildings and find that Class-A demand isn't there."" Although average rents have risen sharply in recent years, some economists, such as Christopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics, say Southern California's future economic growth could be upended by its increasingly unaffordable housing market. Last year in the region, average rents increased by 4.1%, according to CoStar. Average household incomes rose by only 0.74%, according to projections by Moody's Analytics. For its part, TruAmerica believes broader economic trends are on its side, including declining homeownership rates, an increasing population and a dearth of new-housing construction. ""No housing was produced for several years,"" says Mr. Hart of the fallow time in the wake of the financial crisis. ""It's going to be a while until multifamily supply catches up with multifamily demand."" Meanwhile, prices of multifamily properties continue to rise. The average cost of Class B and Class C apartment units rose 17.1% in September compared to a year earlier, according to Reis, a real-estate research firm in New York. And in the Greater Los Angeles area, those same assets rose 31.3% to $207,000 per unit during the same period. That raises the risk that multifamily prices are getting overvalued, says Ryan Severino, a Reis senior economist. But Arty Maharajh, who reviewed some aspects of TruAmerica's recent purchase, says the company is avoiding some of the overvaluation by buying in bulk. The company is ""getting a discount on the number of units [it's] buying,"" says Mr. Maharajh, a vice president of research at commercial brokerage DTZ who didn't work on the deal. He estimates that TruAmerica paid approximately $180,000 per apartment, a rate that is below the $200,000 to $250,000 average costs per unit across Southern California submarkets. Even if rent growth does slow, Mr. O'Rourke of Guardian doesn't expect trouble. ""Should you hit a speed bump, we believe that on the downside you might not get your yield, but you won't lose your principal. We believe that the multifamily business, even in the down cycle, is a nice hedge against down sides in the market.""

Doc_87,A Very Special Day in the FA Cup as Giants Tumble; Chelsea Just One of the Aristocracts Humbled in FA Cup,"Marcotti, Gabriele",None available.,"Some called it the greatest day in the history of the FA Cup. At the very least, for neutrals who love upsets, it was something to savor. Like Duke, North Carolina, Kentucky and Georgetown all losing in the same early round of March Madness. Chelsea, Manchester City and Southampton--the top three teams in the Premier League table--all played at home against opponents further down the English soccer pyramid and all three were upset. So too was Tottenham Hotspur, sixth in the top tier, which hosted Leicester, dead last in the Premier League. And Swansea, ninth in the Premier League, was upended by lower-division Blackburn Rovers. Throw in Liverpool--held at home by Bolton, a mid-table side in the second tier--and Manchester United's scoreless draw at Cambridge United, three divisions and 76 rungs below, and you have one of the most remarkable rounds in the 143 years since the competition began. Talk of the FA Cup's so-called magic is based on such narratives: the idea that anything can happen, that the plucky underdogs can overcome their wealthier, brand-name adversaries. A cold-hearted analytics-type might be unimpressed by all this. They might simply point out that you can calculate the probability of it happening. And while it would be unlikely to happen on any given week, over the course of 143 years, you're pretty much assured of having a round like this. That's the entirely unromantic view. There's obviously a middle ground. Upsets happen in this sport, by its very nature. It's a low-scoring game, so the impact of serious mistakes and individual brilliance is magnified. ""It's the beauty of football, where a better team can lose [and that] is much less likely in a different sport,"" said Chelsea manager Josê© Mourinho. It's why, at the international level, when a bunch of amateurs from San Marino take on professionals even from top nations, you very rarely see scorelines hit double figures. Fundamentally, if you stick 10 able-bodied twentysomethings in a penalty area, even if they aren't particularly good, they'll enjoy some success at keeping their opponents out. Then there's the fact that while transfer spending and total wage bill are correlated to success, they are metrics that need to be taken with a grain of salt. A starter on, say, a second-tier club doesn't earn one third as much as a regular in the top tier because he's one third as good. He earns less, generally speaking, because his club can afford less and, conversely, because the Premier League team can afford more. Labor costs are usually far and away the biggest expense for any club: those with the highest revenues pay commensurately more in wages in part because that's what they're used to doing. There are FA Cup-specific factors as well. Visiting teams receive a greater share of the ticket allocation compared to league games and, for a smaller club traveling to a Premier League juggernaut, this can be a huge factor. Bradford City manager Phil Parkinson, whose third-tier club stunned Premier League pace-setters Chelsea, acknowledged that his men got a major boost from the 6,000 away fans packed behind one of the goals. There's also the rather less pleasant fact that the FA Cup matters less to many clubs than it once did. Doing well in the league is almost always more important to the bottom line. Chelsea rested at least half a dozen players against Bradford. Manchester United traveled to Cambridge without Juan Mata and Wayne Rooney. Tottenham and Swansea, to varying degrees, also fielded under-strength teams. It's a tricky factor to assess. You lose something in terms of chemistry and quality, though that ought to be offset by the fact that a top club's reserves are still going to be considerably better than the opposition, particularly when they're going motivated to prove they deserve more playing time. And even when many of the regulars do play, there's a question of focus. Manchester City flew to Abu Dhabi for warm-weather training and a friendly match last week, returning less than 24 hours before kickoff against Middlesbrough. Manager Manuel Pellegrini insisted it had no bearing on the outcome. He may be right, but it's hard to imagine them making the same trip before a crucial Premier League game. The strange thing is that this is offset by the fact that many of the underdogs also were without key players. Bradford was without starting keeper Jordan Pickford, who was ineligible. Middlesbrough left two players who had started the previous two games on the bench initially. Leicester City, embroiled in the relegation dogfight, rested six players, while Blackburn, chasing the playoffs in the second tier, left its two top scorers out of the starting lineup. What you can probably safely conclude is that change--here in the form of weakened lineups--brings some level of volatility to results, for both sides. And that when there is a perception that a game is less important, you're bound to take more risks as an underdog. Bradford, having battled from two goals down to make the score 2-2, continued to attack and was rewarded. In a league match, the club might have opted to hang on for a point. Rounds like this one cement the FA Cup's appeal, though you wonder how thrilled broadcasters will be at potentially losing so many brand names in the Round of 32. What's clear is that while the magic may endure, it's one of a different sort than in the days of the FA Cup being bigger than the league, the days when it was the most important competition in England.

Doc_88,CIO Journal: News Digest,Anonymous,None available.,"Strategic Infrastructure for Pizza Goes High-Tech Stuffed crust isn't the only battle ground for Domino's Pizza Inc. and Pizza Hut. The chains are promoting smartwatches, connected cars, retinal scanning and other interactive technology for order and delivery. Ordering pizza is a time-honored rite of passage for new technology. The first retail purchase on the Web, Pizza Hut claims, was one of its pizzas. Now Pizza Hut and Domino's are experimenting with just how much change customers can tolerate. Domino's lets customers order from inside Ford Fiestas with voice commands and on Pebble smartwatches. In the U.K., Pizza Hut is testing retinal scanning technology that detects where a customer's eyes rest on a digital menu board and adds toppings accordingly. And both companies closely watch each other's tech moves. ""If you're on Dominos.com and not having the best experience, it's not hard for you to go to one of our competitors,"" says Domino's Chief Information Officer Kevin Vasconi says. Pizza Hut is building an in-car ordering and payment system with Accenture and Visa Inc., which announced the project Monday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The system's beacon technology can alert restaurant staff when the customer pulls into the parking lot, says Carol Clements, U.S. CIO for Pizza Hut, which accounted for $1.1 billion of the $13.3 billion in sales reported last year by parent company Yum Brands Inc. Anticipating customer behavior influences where Pizza Hut invests, Ms. Clements says. Pizza Hut wants to add 100 people, including contractors, to its 160-member technology and digital staff, focusing on analytics talent and mobile developers. At Domino's, tech investments must pay off in sales, conversion rates or new-customer acquisition, Mr. Vasconi says. About half of its $2 billion in 2014 sales came from digital platforms and half of that was from mobile devices, he says. At 200 people, IT is one-third of the company's corporate staff and it wants to hire 50 or 60 more this year. A partnership with Ford Motor Co. to use the Sync AppLink connectivity system lets drivers order Domino's with voice commands. But it isn't a high-traffic ordering vehicle, Mr. Vasconi says. Still, it is one more avenue for orders. ""People want the ultimate convenience of being able to get what they want when they want it,"" said Darren Tristano, an analyst at Technomic Inc., a food-industry consulting firm. Kim S. Nash A New Ubuntu Phone Comes on the Market The open-source Ubuntu-powered mobile phone is moving forward once again, according to Mark Shuttleworth, founder of both Canonical and the Ubuntu Linux operating system. Mr. Shuttleworth envisions the rise of an Ubuntu-powered phone that runs desktop grade applications and plugs into peripherals such as large displays and keyboards. He tried to develop such a phone, known as the Edge, with a widely publicized crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. The campaign ended in 2013, short of its goal. Last month, the first Ubuntu-powered phone came to market when Spanish vendor bq made the Aquaris E 4.5 Ubuntu edition phone available. Meizu of China has plans to make a similar product. But the midrange hardware doesn't connect to large screens or keyboards, which means true convergence will have to wait. Looking further into the future, Mr. Shuttleworth expects that the Edge's promise will be realized. ""Do you need a keyboard, a mouse and large display for certain kinds of productivity? If you are going to work on something substantial...there is no suggestion we will get away from those things for the moment,"" Mr. Shuttleworth said. ""The question is, what is the brain you need?""

Doc_89,Rebuilding Your Career After a Move to Quit; Returning to Work With Bosses and Colleagues You Nearly Abandoned Can Be a Minefield,"Shellenbarger, Sue","Angela Trombatore asked her supervisor for new challenges in a previous job as a marketing specialist, to no avail, says Ms. Trombatore, a Red Bank, N.J., public-relations executive. Employees' relationships with their employers get worse about 9% of the time after they accept a counteroffer, according to a 2005 WorldatWork survey of 284 employers--but 13% of the time, they get better, says Tom McMullen, a practice leader specializing in employee rewards for Hay Group, in Philadelphia, and a co-author of the study.","Talk about awkward. You quit your job to join a rival company--and then are persuaded to stay on. Returning to work with the same bosses and colleagues you were ready to abandon can be a minefield. Your reputation may be dented and your career stalled. Colleagues may be wary, or resentful, if your boss offered you a prize assignment to stay. But in at least as many cases, research shows, staying on can turn out well--yielding stronger ties with colleagues, more career help from your employer or a fresh commitment to the job. Either way, it's a confusing, stressful time. Nick Coppola found himself at the center of a bidding war after resigning from a former employer to join another company. His old employer offered him a raise, a new title and help with his heavy workload to stay. The rival fired back with another offer. ""It was the most stressful situation of my life,"" says Mr. Coppola, a network engineer. Worried about disappointing a boss he liked and respected, he decided to stay. Yet his old employer couldn't meet the needs that had led him to quit in the first place--to work with more experienced mentors and learn new skills. ""It took one month for the buzz of the bigger paycheck to wear off, then I realized, 'Wow, I made a mistake,' "" he says. He quit for good a few months later, disappointing the people he had meant to please. Mr. Coppola says he wishes he'd stayed focused on the reasons he decided to change jobs in the first place. Such dramas are unfolding often as companies struggle to recruit skilled workers. More employers are making counteroffers to try to keep high-performing employees in important positions, employers and recruiters say. The offers often include a raise or new title, or sometimes a new assignment or boss. Angela Trombatore asked her supervisor for new challenges in a previous job as a marketing specialist, to no avail, says Ms. Trombatore, a Red Bank, N.J., public-relations executive. Only after she landed a new job did the president of the company call her to his office and ask, ""How can we make you stay?"" she says. He offered a raise, a new title and new duties. Ms. Trombatore felt a little awkward telling colleagues she was staying after everyone expected her to leave. They supported her, however, she says, and she continued to get yearly promotions and stayed four more years. Some employees get in over their heads in such situations, recruiters say. Entertaining rival offers can brand an employee as ""a flight risk or a diva,"" says Jim Stroud, a senior director at Randstad Sourceright, in Atlanta, a recruitment and staffing firm. Some bosses panic at the prospect of having an important job go vacant and have a ""knee-jerk reaction,"" promising whatever it takes to keep an employee for a while, and then firing him or her when a replacement is found, Mr. Stroud says. Other employees who have explored other jobs find themselves in a career netherworld, bypassed for promotions or new projects, says Miriam Salpeter, an Atlanta job-search coach. If you are repeatedly cut out of the office grapevine or important meetings you used to attend, she advises meeting with the boss, restating your commitment and exploring your prospects within the company. It can take time to rebuild trust. Employees who decide to stay after quitting should put in more face time for a while, says Kathy Robinson, a Boston career and executive coach. ""Make sure you're in lock step with your boss,"" working toward the same goals and making long-term plans, she says. ""Seek out managers and let them know you're glad to be there."" It may take additional effort to rebuild bridges if co-workers know you resigned. Colleagues who see a co-worker skip ahead of them in pay or title because of a counteroffer may become resentful, she says. Also, ""it can cause a chain reaction,"" prompting others to job-hunt too. Deciding to stick around can work out well. Employees' relationships with their employers get worse about 9% of the time after they accept a counteroffer, according to a 2005 WorldatWork survey of 284 employers--but 13% of the time, they get better, says Tom McMullen, a practice leader specializing in employee rewards for Hay Group, in Philadelphia, and a co-author of the study. Some employees recommit to their current jobs after the excitement of the chase dies down. Chris Bryan accepted a big pay raise and a promise of an equity stake to join a startup two years ago because it appealed to his ambitious, competitive nature, he says. He soon began having second thoughts. His wife even remarked, ""You don't seem excited"" about the offer, says Mr. Bryan, a sales manager in Europe for Qlik, a Radnor, Pa., maker of business-analytics software. Qlik offered Mr. Bryan a smaller raise to stay. The company doesn't match rivals' salary offers ""because money shouldn't be the main reason people stay or go,"" says Diane Adams, Qlik's chief people officer; they should see value in other areas. Mr. Bryan realized he would miss the ""things money can't buy"" at Qlik, including close teamwork and access to top management, he says, adding, ""I felt like I was leaving a family."" He decided he could satisfy his ambitions without leaving. Word of his resignation had leaked to a few colleagues, but Mr. Bryan soon demonstrated that he was ""more determined to succeed"" at Qlik than ever. He took over a sales team that had been missing its targets. The group increased revenue sharply last year, and Mr. Bryan was named a manager of the year. Resignations also can trigger helpful conversations with managers. Software engineer Paul Faria liked his boss and the friendly, open culture at his employer, Ultimate Software, and worried that giving notice would be like ""telling your family you're moving out,"" he says. He was intrigued, however, by a chance to work on different products, and accepted a friend's offer last year to join his small company. Mr. Faria and his boss, Keith Wilson, didn't tell Mr. Faria's teammates about his decision. Instead, Mr. Wilson tried to figure out ""what it was about this new job that he found interesting,"" says Mr. Wilson, director, software engineering, at the Weston, Fla.-based maker of human-resources software. He invited several experienced colleagues to mentor Mr. Faria about career opportunities at a large company such as Ultimate Software. Mr. Faria says the talks changed his perspective; he decided to stay, and his relationship with Mr. Wilson has grown stronger, both men say. Mr. Faria has since helped his boss arrange for engineers on his team to give each other feedback on their skills, which has ""definitely been a confidence-booster"" for Mr. Faria, he says. Mr. Wilson says he is finding new ways to talk with employees about advancing their careers within the company. Quitting is an emotional process that can bring up feelings employees didn't know they had. Larry Rosenfield didn't decide until after his going-away party with 20 colleagues at a Mexican restaurant that he wanted to keep his old job as a hotel-sales executive. His 12-year-old daughter, Hannah, who attended the party, remarked, ""Dad, you really seemed to like the people you work with, and they really seem to like you,"" Mr. Rosenfield says. ""That's when it hit me,"" he says: He valued his colleagues too much to leave. Senior executives were dubious; some questioned his commitment. ""What you do know is that I have a three-year track record, and I'm trying to be as transparent with you as possible about my feelings,"" Mr. Rosenfield told them. He got his old job back and moved quietly back into his office. His colleagues were surprised, but ""I answered any question and tried to be as professional as I could possibly be,"" he says. He also made a point of working hard. Two years later, he's still there, and happy. Asking for your old job after your going-away party ""is not a strategy that I would recommend,"" he says, but he is glad he did. Before quitting any job, Mr. Rosenfield says, ""take a moment to step back and reflect on what you have.""

Doc_90,Looming Bank Rules Haunt Insurers; Insurance companies could struggle under proposal meant to make lenders safe enough to fail,"Carney, John","The likes of American International Group, Prudential Financial and MetLife scored a win last year when Congress passed a bill allowing the Federal Reserve to craft capital standards tailored for insurers rather than subject them to those designed for the biggest banks.","The biggest U.S. insurance firms may be facing another clash with banking regulation. The likes of American International Group, Prudential Financial and MetLife scored a win last year when Congress passed a bill allowing the Federal Reserve to craft capital standards tailored for insurers rather than subject them to those designed for the biggest banks. But big insurers are hardly out of the woods. In a recent letter, Financial Stability Board Chairman Mark Carney said global regulators are preparing rules for insurers similar to total-loss absorption capacity requirements proposed for banks last year. The basic idea is to make the failure of financial firms less costly for taxpayers. The proposal would require banks to have loss-absorbing capacity of 16% to 20% of risk-weighted assets, comprised of regulatory capital plus long-term unsecured debt. The latter would have to make up one-third of a bank's loss-absorbing capacity. Relative to banks, insurance firms tend to have little long-term debt at the holding-company level. MetLife had just $16.2 billion as of Dec. 21, 2014, equal to about 2% of its liabilities. The figure for J.P. Morgan Chase is about 12%. Insurers differ from banks because they aren't taking deposits or making loans. They usually hold big books of low-risk assets whose maturities match the timing of expected policy payouts. Their primary liabilities are to policyholders. So applying a banklike rule would trigger a big shift in insurers' balance sheets. A requirement for more parent company debt also could endanger credit ratings, notes Karen Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics. Fortunately, insurance firms likely have time to make their case against these rules. But it should remind investors that regulation still poses unpredictable risks.

The Dow added 6.62 points, or less than 0.1%, to close at 17673.02. The blue-chip index was boosted by stronger-than-expected results at Walt Disney Co., which saw its shares rally 7.6%. The Dow is a price-weighted index which tends to be influenced by pricier components such as Disney. The S&P 500 fell 8.52 points, or 0.4%, to 2041.51, and the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 11.03 points, or 0.2%, to 4716.70. The ECB said Wednesday it would no longer accept Greek public securities as collateral for regular central bank loans . Greek banks will still have access to funds through the ECB's emergency lending program. The announcement comes as Greece's government seeks to ease conditions on its bailout program . ""It reinforces the uncertainty that was introduced with the Greek elections,"" said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments, which manages about $45.6 billion. ""The overtures from the new Greek government were encouraging in that there would be some kind of resolution, possibly a restructuring of Greek debt...now the ECB's comments suggest that it is far from certain,"" he added. Traders said stock moves in recent weeks have been driven by bets on indexes rather than on individual stocks. That comes amid an increased focus on moves in oil prices and currencies, as well as political developments overseas, such as the new Greek government's talks with its creditors, which are overshadowing fourth-quarter earnings, they said. ""It seems like there's an inordinate amount of uncertainty in the world,"" said Michael Fredericks, portfolio manager of the BlackRock Multi-Asset Income Fund, which has $10.2 billion under management. ""It's hard to have a lot of conviction."" Crude-oil futures tumbled 8.7% to $48.45 a barrel , snapping a four-session streak of gains. Energy stocks fell 1.6%, down the most on the S&P 500.

Several companies have noted the broad strength in the U.S. dollar as they report earnings. On Wednesday, Merck & Co. said its sales fell in the fourth quarter, pressured by a stronger U.S. dollar and patent expirations. Shares slipped 3.2%. Justin Wiggs, a trader at Stifel Nicolaus, noted that companies blamed the weather for weak earnings during 2013's fourth quarter. After the early-year pullback in 2014, stocks continued to grind higher. ""This year, we're explaining them away with currency moves,"" he said, referring to weak earnings. ""The excuse is different, but is it the same game?"" Investors continued to watch international developments, especially in Greece. European stocks rose, with France's CAC 40 up 0.4% and Germany's DAX 30 gaining 0.2%. ""We're in a period where the market is really thrashing around,"" said Jeff Morris, head of U.S. equities at Standard Life Investments. ""It has to do a balancing act between those portions of the U.S. economy showing genuine strength and recovery and international influences,"" such as global growth concerns, he added. Back in the U.S., consumer discretionary stocks rose the most on the S&P 500, up 0.7%. Mr. Fredericks of BlackRock said he's attracted to sectors of the stock market that could benefit from increased consumer spending, such as some retailers and auto companies. But overall, he said he has reduced stock exposure in his fund this year amid increased international headwinds, high U.S. valuations and a slowdown in earnings growth. Among individual stocks, car maker General Motors Co. said fourth-quarter profit surged 91%, beating analyst expectations . The company said it plans to boost its dividend starting in the second quarter. Shares rose 5.4%. Staples Inc. agreed to buy Office Depot Inc. for $6.3 billion. Shares of Staples fell 12%, while those of Office Depot added 2.2%.

""With the economy on firmer footing, inflation expectations subdued, corporations returning capital aggressively to shareholders, those all point to an attractive environment for equities,"" he added.

More than 50 House Democrats delivered a letter Thursday to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell calling for immediate guidance that would classify pregnancy as a ""qualifying life event."" That designation would let uninsured women who become pregnant to sign up for coverage through HealthCare.gov within 60 days and outside the open-enrollment period. More than 30 national health advocacy groups, including Families USA and Planned Parenthood, sent their own letter Thursday to HHS supporting the change. And over 50,000 people signed a petition endorsing the move that was delivered to the agency, according to the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The letters and the petition mark the latest efforts to push HHS to change its rule. In a March 3 letter, 37 Senate Democrats urged Ms. Burwell to let pregnant women use HealthCare.gov to sign up for health care. The exchange's open-enrollment period is generally about three months long, and the latest ended Feb. 15. ""These women are forced to either forgo critical prenatal care or face significant out-of-pocket costs,"" the House Democrats' letter said. ""Special enrollment periods currently exist for qualifying life events like the birth of a child or the adoption of a child.

In addition to a birth or adoption, other life events that trigger an enrollment period include moving to a new state, some changes in income and changes in family size, including marriage and divorce. ""The number of health advocates, members of Congress, and average Americans calling for this change highlights the importance of this issue and should inspire special urgency for the Department of Health and Human Services,"" Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D., N.J.), who spearheaded the House letter, said in a statement. HHS said in regulations issued in February that it had no plans to allow a special enrollment period for women becoming pregnant. Federal officials said states could add such a period if they chose. The agency declined to comment further on Thursday. Opponents of a special enrollment period for pregnant women, such as insurers, said that many women would forgo insurance until they become pregnant, potentially driving up premium costs. ""Health plans want to ensure women have access to the care that they need at all stages of their lives,"" said Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group. ""But if individuals are incentivized only to sign up for coverage when they need care, then that has a significant impact on affordability for everyone."" In the U.S., about 4 million women give birth each year. Among women and newborns with employer-provided commercial health insurance, the average doctor and hospital bills for a vaginal birth totaled $32,093, according to a January 2013 study by Truven Health Analytics, a provider of health-care data and consulting services. The cost rose to $51,125 for a caesarean birth. Changing the rules would largely help young women. Eighty-three percent of new mothers are between the ages of 18 and 34, according to a report by Young Invincibles. The health law requires insurance plans sold on individual and small group markets to include maternity care as one of 10 essential benefits. But some women lack maternity coverage because their plan is exempt from providing the essential benefits. Pregnant women who meet income eligibility requirements can obtain maternity care through Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor.

Doc_94,HUD Secretary Defends Decision to Lower FHA Fees; Juliêçn Castro Faces Tough Questioning at House Hearing,"Light, Joe",None available.,"The Obama administration's top housing official at a congressional hearing on Wednesday defended a decision to lower fees charged by a government-loan program for low-wealth borrowers. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juliêçn Castro sparred for 41_ÅÊ2 hours with Republican lawmakers at the House Financial Services Committee, many of whom said they believed the decision was reckless in the face of the program's weak balance sheet. Mr. Castro argued that the agency could afford to make the cuts, while still returning to health, and said that the lower fees were needed to enable more low-income Americans to become homeowners. The hearing came as many housing regulators are struggling to strike a balance between helping the housing market, which has largely lagged behind other parts of the economy, while not returning to the policies that fostered the housing boom and bust. Last month, the same House committee grilled Melvin Watt, who regulates mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, over a decision to allow the companies to guarantees loans with down payments of as little as 3%. In the lead-up to the State of the Union Address in January, President Barack Obama announced that the Federal Housing Administration, which is housed within HUD, would lower the fees it charges a typical borrower by half a percentage point to 0.85%. The FHA doesn't make loans, but sells insurance to make investors whole in case of default. Borrowers pay for the insurance and through the program can make down payments of as little as 3.5%. The FHA suffered heavy losses on loans it made toward the tail end of the housing boom, and in 2013 required a $1.7 billion bailout from the U.S. Treasury. The law requires the agency to have a capital buffer equal to at least 2% of the loans it guarantees, a threshold it hasn't met since 2009. Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) described the decision to cut premiums as the ""administration's taxpayer-funded race to the bottom to become the nation's largest subprime lender"" in his opening remarks. ""After all these years, at what point does HUD and the FHA intend to follow the law?"" said Mr. Hensarling during questioning. Mr. Castro said that he believed the FHA's finances would still improve rapidly despite the fee cuts. ""The fact is that over the last several years since the crisis started, several safeguards have been put in place that helped strengthen the economic value of the fund,"" Mr. Castro said. Mr. Castro said that the premium cuts would push back the return to the 2% mandate by ""a few months."" Some other estimates have been less sanguine. Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi estimated that the fund might not return to the 2% level until 2018, two years later than an estimate made by the FHA's independent actuary in November. Still, Mr. Zandi said that the FHA had room for the cut, given that he doesn't expect another severe housing downturn to happen soon. On the other hand, others say they fear that the reduction in fees could just be an early step in a return to loose-credit policies of the past. ""None of these things by themselves represent a dramatic restarting of the housing bubble,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative economic think tank, and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. ""But getting low-income, higher-risk borrowers into homes...that attitude is what got us in trouble."" Democrats on the committee largely supported the decision to lower FHA fees, with at least one congressman suggesting that they could be lowered even further.

Doc_95,Real Estate Unit of Italy's Generali Planning Move into Asia; Push is part of group-wide expansion away from insurer's European roots,"Patnaude, Art","For the majority of European property investors Asia is less attractive than Europe, where real-estate prices are perceived to have room to grow amid a flood of capital from the European Central Bank's bond buying program, Mr. Green-Morgan said.","The real estate arm of Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali SpA is planning a big push into Asia as part of a group-wide expansion away from its European roots. Generali Real Estate SpA currently holds nearly all of its [euro]28 billion ($29.6 billion) property portfolio in Europe. But Chief Executive Officer Christian Delaire said it expects to eventually have 10% to 15% of the portfolio in Asian markets such as China and Indonesia. ""We're basically starting from scratch,"" Mr. Delaire said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He declined to say how long it would take to reach the target in Asia. ""It will not be too quickly, but our ambitions are high,"" he said. Global property investors have increasingly moved into foreign markets, or new asset classes such as student housing, on the hunt for higher returns in a low interest rate environment. But while Asian investors have been quick to embrace Europe, movement the other way is far less common. In the past 12 months, $2.4 billion flowed into Asian real-estate markets from Europe, data from Real Capital Analytics show. In the same period, data show $17.4 billion flowed into Europe from Asia. The biggest European investors buying property in Asia are large insurers such as Prudential PLC in the U.K. and AXA Group in France, which already have insurance operations in the region. Generali's insurance business, the third largest in Europe, is looking to expand its business in Asia, Mr. Delaire said. European insurers ""are running global businesses anyway,"" said David Green-Morgan, global capital markets research director at broker JLL in Singapore. ""It is much easier for them to deploy money to the Asia-Pacific region."" For the majority of European property investors Asia is less attractive than Europe, where real-estate prices are perceived to have room to grow amid a flood of capital from the European Central Bank's bond buying program, Mr. Green-Morgan said. Generali Real Estate currently has 40% of its assets in Italy, and 57% in the rest of Europe. U.S. assets account for 1.5% of its portfolio, and Asia is less than 1%. Generali Real Estate's previous acquisitions in Asia were purely aimed at supporting the wider group's insurance operations. For instance, three years ago Generali Real Estate purchased part of the Prosper Center in Beijing as offices for Generali China. The firm has yet to close any deals in Asia under its new strategy, but ""we're close to one or two,"" said Mr. Delaire, who joined as chief executive officer last April. In addition to supporting the group's expanding insurance operations in Asia, the planned move will aim to diversify Generali Real Estate's exposure and help insulate it from any financial shocks, Mr. Delaire said. Shocks to the increasingly global financial system are certain, and ""diversifying will help smooth these problems along the way,"" he said. Generali Real Estate hired Andy Tan, a former vice president at Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund, in December to oversee its Asian expansion from Singapore. Generali also plans to increase its real estate exposure to the U.K., Spain and Poland. And it isn't ruling out future expansion into other markets such as the U.S., Mr. Delaire said.

Doc_96,Swiss Currency Move Shows Risks of Highly Interconnected Financial System; Ripple Effect of Swiss National Bank's Decision Is Reminder of Unexpected Threats,"Ryan, Tracy; McGrane, Victoria; Ackerman, Andrew","The market volatility also spilled over into losses at big global banks that trade in currencies as a core part of their business, such as Citigroup, Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays PLC. Citigroup also provided prime brokerage services to a large U.S. currency broker caught up in the volatility, FXCM, Inc. Regulatory officials said Friday they didn't see any immediate threats to U.S. financial stability.","The ripple effect of wild swings in the price of Switzerland's currency is a reminder the next threat to today's highly interconnected financial system could come from an unexpected place. The sudden decision by the Swiss National Bank on Thursday to remove a cap on the Swiss franc's value posed a threat to the solvency of currency brokers, many of whom sit outside the banking system that has received the brunt of new regulations since the 2008 financial crisis. The market volatility also spilled over into losses at big global banks that trade in currencies as a core part of their business, such as Citigroup, Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays PLC. Citigroup also provided prime brokerage services to a large U.S. currency broker caught up in the volatility, FXCM, Inc. Regulatory officials said Friday they didn't see any immediate threats to U.S. financial stability. U.S. agencies were talking among themselves and to market participants as they sought to understand the extent to which big banks, clearing houses that guarantee some currency trades and other market players are exposed to the troubled brokerages or to the currency itself, and how their actions could ripple across the financial system in unexpected ways. Spokesmen for the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission said their agencies were ""monitoring"" developments. Staff of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of senior U.S. regulators, were also watching the situation, a person familiar with the matter said Friday. A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, which chairs the council, declined to comment. At the Federal Reserve, officials are looking into losses major global banks are taking and likely investigating whether any highly-leveraged hedge funds have found themselves on the wrong side of a trade that could trigger broader consequences. Another area of potential focus is how the various firms that operate the financial plumbing for foreign-exchange and other markets are reacting to events. The Fed created a new postcrisis Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research in 2010 to investigate weak links in the financial system. One mitigating factor from a financial stability standpoint is that the Swiss action didn't come amid broader market turmoil. The events were a ""reminder [of] how dependent market stability is on government action and how even one seemingly small move can unsettle everything really quickly,"" said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of the policy analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics, Inc. Regulators say the financial system is stronger thanks to the reforms implemented since 2008, in particular rules that forced the largest, most interconnected banks to maintain far higher levels of capital to absorb unexpected losses. ""Significantly more capital in banks is a good thing and they're likely to be more resilient,"" former Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy Stein said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this week. ""There's less worry, I would say, about the banking system being at the center of something."" But Mr. Stein and others acknowledge that by bulletproofing banks' balance sheets, policy makers may be pushing activity outside the banking system into areas where risks are more difficult to monitor. In the interview, Mr. Stein pointed to the ""very, very rapid growth of issuance of corporate bonds"" held by nonbank entities as one area where potential risks should be investigated. The events of Thursday and Friday put activities by less-heavily regulated exchange brokers on regulators' radar as well. Capital requirements for those firms aren't as high as for banks, meaning they are less able to weather unexpected losses. Another potential area of concern is that capital rules for foreign-exchange brokers don't currently exist in Europe, where regulators have consistently lagged behind their U.S. counterparts on postcrisis rules. While European policy makers have floated proposed rules, they would likely revisit them in light of the FXCM tumult, said Bart Chilton, a senior policy adviser at DLA Piper LLP and former CFTC commissioner. One of the key reforms of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law was to move trading in relatively opaque financial products, like derivatives, onto centralized clearinghouses, which take fees to guarantee trades and force traders to post collateral known as margin. The potential downside: Those clearinghouses have become increasingly important parts of the financial system, meaning that their own actions could have broad ripple effects. Banks and others have raised concerns with regulators that clearinghouses now pose a new threat to financial stability and have called for actions to beef up their resiliency. The Financial Stability Oversight Council is probing the issue in an effort to evaluate what risks clearinghouses might pose.

Everyone is a cop on the beat. Everyone is also a target. Build a comprehensive education system from top to bottom of the company that includes governance that embraces security at every step. 2. Cyber Risk = Business Risk Categorize what data in your company is the most critical. Make it clear to everyone how a breach would translate to business impact. 3. Don't Hunker in the Bunker Don't think of security as the gate at the end of the process that restricts innovation. Put it at the front end of product development to enable the solution. Engineer it into every step of the process. 4. Anticipate the Cyber 9/11 Cybersecurity needs to be elevated to an international level, which means companies across industries and governments across regions must organize for this battle. They should view it as securing a common cyberborder. Co-Chairs Tammy Jeffery, Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, General Growth Properties Lidia L.

Beyond the Usual Suspects Take risks and refrain from simply checking a box. Be open to raw talent who have the smarts, the ambition, the enthusiasm and the curiosity. Also look for people who understand how 'Year Zero' works with technology, and who are commercially minded. This strategy requires the CIO to take ownership and develop and install a path for their success. 2. Wired for Change Change is constant; look for people who come at problems from a different perspective. Are we talking about a risk taker? Yes. But not someone who just takes risks. Recruit people who are incredibly adaptive to and can drive rapid change, both personally and professionally. 3. Leaders and Superstars Identify and build leaders and superstars. Leadership is the '""It"" factor. CIOs should invest their time in budding leaders. Let them know they are making a difference in the organization. Create leadership education/mentorships for the top technical talent so they won't fail when offered more responsibility. Be sure your organization can identify, develop and reward the superstars. 4. Create a 'Sticky' Culture Create an environment for talent to come, stay and grow, and a narrative defining innovation in terms of what your company does best.

Doc_98,Oil Drilling Slows as Crude Price Drops; Companies Drilled 28% Fewer Wells in January Than They Did Last June,"Gilbert, Daniel",The U.S. Energy Information Administration found that oil production is increasing at a slower rate in four big producing regions of the U.S.; the agency estimates that U.S. producers pumped about 9.2 million barrels a day in January.,"The U.S. oil boom is slowing down as drillers cut back in response to lower crude prices, according to new data set to be released on Wednesday. Companies drilled 28% fewer oil wells in January across the continental U.S. than they did last June, before oil prices started falling from more than $100 a barrel to about $50 today, according to the study by Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. But the amount of new crude they can pump from wells drilled in January totals an estimated 515,000 barrels a day, only 8.5% less than from the wells drilled in June, according to data provided for the study by DrillingInfo, an analytics firm. Energy mavens around the world are watching for any sign that American oil companies are pumping less crude as a glut of petroleum has sent global prices plunging by about 50% since June. Rising U.S. production from shale fields has been a big contributor to the glut, along with tepid demand for oil in economies around the world. The new data suggest that U.S. shale producers are responding faster to the drop in prices than energy companies have in the past, which could translate into lower production and hasten a recovery in crude prices. Shale wells roar into life and then decline more quickly than conventional wells. ""You've got this nimble new mode of production that can enter the market and exit the market quickly,"" said Jim Krane, an energy fellow at Rice University and lead author of the study. In contrast to previous oil busts, he adds, ""now you have a supplier that is price-sensitive and can curtail supply quickly."" The report is based on new onshore wells drilled in most states in the continental U.S., provided by DrillingInfo, and on drilling rigs tracked by Baker Hughes Inc., an oil-field services company. The DrillingInfo data include wells that have been drilled but aren't necessarily pumping oil yet; the firm estimates how much oil the wells can tap based on the average peak production of similar wells drilled nearby. The findings echo similar points made by two analyses earlier this week. The U.S. Energy Information Administration found that oil production is increasing at a slower rate in four big producing regions of the U.S.; the agency estimates that U.S. producers pumped about 9.2 million barrels a day in January. The International Energy Agency similarly projected slower growth in U.S. production as a result of lower prices. The U.S. oil price fell $2.84, to $50.02 a barrel on Tuesday, but remains 12.5% higher than its lowest point this year. The retreat in drilling isn't uniform across the U.S., and it is still difficult to determine where the cutbacks will be the harshest. In some drilling hotbeds, like the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas, the number of new oil wells actually increased during the months when oil prices fell most steeply, from November to January, according to the Rice study. The Permian Basin, in West Texas and New Mexico, posted the sharpest decline in new oil wells, adding 15.6% less production capacity in January than in June. Most of the decline appeared to come from conventional, vertical wells, and not the ones that bore horizontally through the rock and deliver the biggest volumes of oil and gas. The Bakken formation, which has made North Dakota the second-largest oil-producing state after Texas, also experienced a downturn in new wells. But both the Bakken and the Permian are often impacted by severe winter weather that causes a slowdown. DrillingInfo's data goes back to March 2014, not long enough to compare current drilling levels with a year ago.

The co-founders of Interana are in the latter camp. A husband-and-wife team that joined forces at Caltech, Ann and Bobby Johnson had illustrious careers at Facebook and Intel, respectively, before launching their big-data analytics firm. The Johnsons unveiled their company last October. This week, they are announcing new $20 million financing that includes two big Hadoop backers: Mike Volpi, a partner at Index Ventures and among the earlier backers Hortonworks, a Hadoop standard-bearer, and Mike Olson, a senior executive at another Hadoop startup called Cloudera.

Interana says its technology can make sense of incoming information in seconds and let users analyze their business without requiring technicians who know how to work with Hadoop, which is notorious for its complexity. Asana, which sells workplace collaboration and task-management software, said it used Interana to pinpoint hiccups in its service without forcing engineers to spend hours sifting through records of its users' every online interaction. Interana is based in part on technology developed at Facebook to do tasks like sniffing out quickly why the social network was bogging down and providing easy-to-understand visual graphs to explain the problem, so people who didn't have a Ph.D. in data science could understand the results. Interana, in essence, is a version of the Facebook tool, known as SCUBA, for the broader corporate world.

Doc_100,Japan Tourism Boom Draws Hotel Investors; Investment Hit Post-Crisis High Last Year,"Narioka, Kosaku",None available.,"TOKYO--Investors are buying Japanese hotels at the fastest pace since before the global financial crisis, attracted by high returns and strong growth prospects in a booming tourism sector. The rising investment also reflects growing interest in Japan's broader, long-dormant real-estate sector as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's policies have weakened the yen and loosened lending conditions, while unlocking the nation's potential as a tourist destination. Investment in Japanese hotels by value last year rose to ‰297 billion ($2.5 billion), the most since 2007, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a U.S.-based data and research provider. That's less than half the total seen in 2007, but around nine times the post-crisis low of ‰32.3 billion in 2009. Among recent deals, U.S. private-equity firm Bain Capital LLC has agreed to buy Japanese hotel operator Oedo-Onsen Holdings, people familiar with the matter said Friday. Oedo-Onsen runs 29 hotels and bathhouses in Japan, and a person familiar with the transaction put the deal's value at ‰50 billion ($423 million). Tourism in Japan is growing rapidly. A record 13.4 million foreign tourists visited the country last year, an increase of nearly a third from a year earlier, the government said last month, following a more-than-two-year plunge in the yen and a relaxation of visa requirements which made it a more affordable and convenient destination. The government has set a target of 20 million visitors a year by 2020, when Tokyo will host the Olympics. Crucially for the hospitality sector, spending by foreign tourists jumped 40% last year, while the number of visitors from China, who spend more than travelers from other countries, nearly doubled, Japanese tourism officials said. ""Tourism is a huge growth sector in Japan,"" said Fred Schmidt, founding partner at GreenOak Investment Management K.K. in Tokyo, which purchased the 377-room Renaissance Okinawa Resort and a smaller hotel in June. The two properties cost ‰12.5 billion, according to Real Capital Analytics. To be sure, Japan is far from a global tourism hot spot. It ranked only 27th worldwide in foreign visitors in 2013, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. English isn't as commonly spoken in Tokyo as in other major Asian cities such as Singapore and Hong Kong, and those in the industry say it doesn't offer enough tourist-friendly budget transportation options. And it was only four years ago that an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown paralyzed the country and shocked people around the world. Still, many investors see great potential. Hotel properties in Japan offer relatively high returns. In 2013, they generated total returns--income plus capital gains--of 8.1%, compared with 7.1% in the U.S. and 6.1% in Singapore, according to Investment Property Databank Ltd. Returns in Japan rose to 10.4% as of June 2014, it said. Revenue per available rooms, the industry's key performance metric, grew roughly 10% each year over the past three years in local currency terms, more than in other key markets such as the U.S., U.K. Australia, and Singapore, according to STR Global data. And Japanese hotels don't charge as much as rivals in other major economies. The average daily rate in 2014 was $123, compared with $236 in Singapore and $220 in France, according to STR Global. The yen's decline against the U.S. dollar since late 2012--it has lost around a third of its value--has also helped attract foreign investors by making properties cheaper in dollar terms. Last year, foreign investment in Japanese hotels totaled ‰68 billion, according to Real Capital Analytics. Arthur Buser, executive managing director for Asia Pacific at CBRE Group Inc.'s hotels operation, a commercial real-estate brokerage, said a greater availability of loans from Japanese lenders is also attracting investors. More lenders are also starting to use forward-looking valuation methods, employing expected future cash flows instead of historical cash flows. Japanese banks are eager to lend money because government bonds, their traditional investments, are offering paltry yields due to the Bank of Japan's asset-purchase program. Tomohiko Sawayanagi, managing director for Japan at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. hotels & hospitality group, said the acquisition market has been competitive, with properties often attracting bids from more than 10 investors. Among the biggest hotel deals last year were Hulic Co.'s acquisition of the 703-room Tokyo Bay Maihama Hotel Club Resort in July, which was ‰35 billion, according to a person familiar with the transaction, and GreenOak's purchase of the Okinawa resort. The asset-manager of Hoshino Resorts REIT Inc. bought 24 inns and roadside hotels across the Japanese archipelago in May for ‰18 billion. Among other recent deals, CDL Hospitality Real Estate Investment Trust, run by Singapore-based M&C REIT Management Ltd., in December bought two hotels in Tokyo with a total of 254 rooms for ‰5.8 billion, its first investments in Japan. ""We would like to expand further in Japan,"" said Vincent Yeo, chief executive of M&C REIT Management.

Morgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The annual drop in head count was the fourth year in a row, according to Coalition.","Wall Street is continuing to shrink, according to a new report Thursday. The 10 largest global investment banks dropped staffing levels among bankers and traders to 51,600 in 2014, down 4% from 2013, according to financial-services analytics firm Coalition. The figures reflect staffing levels at the 10 largest global investment banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The annual drop in head count was the fourth year in a row, according to Coalition. The move came as banks faced increasing pressure from regulators and shareholders to contain costs and reduce staffing. The bulk of the reduction came in banks' fixed income, currencies and commodities, or ""FICC,"" divisions, which saw a 9% cut in front-office employees, compared with a 1% decrease in both the equities and investment banking divisions. Total FICC revenue in 2014 fell to $69.4 billion, down 7% from the year before. Despite a surge in commodities and foreign exchange trading in the fourth quarter, weakness in the European credit markets helped pull FICC revenue to its lowest level since 2008 and less than half of 2009 revenue. Coalition also noted 2014 was a good year for investment banking, which saw revenue increase 6% to $40.5 billion. Buoyed by a robust year in deal making, mergers and acquisitions revenue grew 16% while equity capital markets revenue increased 11%. Separately, equities trading revenue among the top investment banks edged down 2% in 2014.

Doc_102,U.S. Officials Pressed to Let Pregnant Women Enroll in Health-Law Plans at Any Time; Health-Care advocacy groups want pregnancy to be declared a 'qualifying life event',"Armour, Stephanie","Among women and newborns with employer-provided commercial health insurance, the average doctor and hospital bills for a vaginal birth was $32,093, according to a January 2013 study by Truven Health Analytics, a provider of health care data and consulting services.\n","WASHINGTON--Pressure is mounting on the Obama administration to allow uninsured women who become pregnant to obtain health coverage at any time of year through the Affordable Care Act's federal exchange. More than 50 House Democrats have signed a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, calling for immediate guidance that would classify pregnancy as a ""qualifying life event."" That designation would let uninsured women who become pregnant to sign up for health insurance through HealthCare.gov within 60 days and outside the open-enrollment period. In addition, more than 30 national health advocates, including Planned Parenthood and Families USA, on Thursday will also press HHS to take action by delivering a separate letter advocating the change. Also, more than 50,000 people have signed a petition, according to the advocacy group Young Invincibles, that will be delivered to HHS Thursday. The petition asks the agency to take steps to allow women to sign up for health-care coverage through HealthCare.gov outside the official enrollment period if they become pregnant. The open enrollment period under the ACA for plans on the federal exchange is generally about three months long, and the latest ended Feb. 15. The House Democrats' letter and the petition mark the latest effort by lawmakers to push HHS to change its rule. On March 3, 37 Senate Democrats sent a letter to Ms. Burwell urging her to allow pregnant women to sign up for health coverage when they find out they are expecting. The signers included Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.). ""These women are forced to either forgo critical prenatal care or face significant out-of-pocket costs,"" the House Democrats' letter said. ""Special enrollment periods currently exist for qualifying life events like the birth of a child or the adoption of a child. We believe pregnancy should trigger a similar special enrollment period."" In addition to the birth of a baby and adoption, other ""qualifying life events"" that trigger an enrollment period include moving to a new state, some changes in income and changes in family size, including marriage and divorce. HHS said in February it had no plans to change its rules to allow a special enrollment period for women who become pregnant. Federal officials said states could add such a period if they chose. Those who oppose the special enrollment have said medical coverage during pregnancy can be expensive and that many women would forgo insurance until they become pregnant. The health law requires health plans sold on individual and small group markets to include maternity care as one of 10 essential health benefits. But some women lack maternity coverage because their plan is exempt from providing the essential benefits. For example, people covered by plans that were ""grandfathered"" into health insurance system are exempt from providing those benefits. Also, women who are dependents on a parent's employer-sponsored plan, or who are on state-funded student health plan, might not have maternity coverage. Pregnant women who meet income eligibility requirements can obtain maternity care through Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor. Changing the rules would largely help young women. Eighty-three percent of new mothers are between the ages of 18 and 34, according to a report by Young Invincibles. In the U.S., about 4 million women give birth each year. Childbirth can be costly. Among women and newborns with employer-provided commercial health insurance, the average doctor and hospital bills for a vaginal birth was $32,093, according to a January 2013 study by Truven Health Analytics, a provider of health care data and consulting services. The cost rose to $51,125 for a caesarean birth. ""The number of health advocates, members of Congress, and average Americans calling for this change highlights the importance of this issue and should inspire special urgency for the Department of Health and Human Services,"" Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D., N.J.), who spearheaded the House letter, said in a statement.

Doc_103,"Foreign Banks Brace for Fed Stress Tests; Firms hire staff, overhaul operations to meet tougher requirements","Ryan, Tracy; Turner, Matt","Overseas lenders such as Deutsche Bank, Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse AG, and UBS AG are now spending heavily and recruiting project managers, data experts and other staff needed to run the complex computer models involved in the Fed's annual exercise.","WASHINGTON--The Federal Reserve's growing scrutiny of global banks has set off a scramble among foreign firms as they staff up and revamp operations to meet the central bank's rising expectations. The Fed's stress tests are expected to find shortcomings in risk management at the U.S. units of some foreign banks, including Deutsche Bank AG and Banco Santander SA, according to people familiar with the matter. The Fed announces preliminary results of this year's tests on Thursday and full results on March 11. The foreign banks are finding themselves tripped up not by capital requirements but by what the Fed sees as flaws in how they measure and predict risks and losses at their sprawling operations, including businesses that haven't been heavily regulated in the past. Last March, for example, the Fed found ""widespread and significant deficiencies"" in Santander's stress testing and capital planning, including governance of its U.S. operations. The central bank restricted dividend payments by the firm's U.S. arm, but in a sign that governance remains a challenge, Santander's U.S. auto-lending subsidiary later declared a dividend that violated the Fed's order. The auto-lending unit has declined to comment on the dividend-payment misstep. The potential stress-test failures would mark the second straight year multiple European firms didn't meet the Fed's expectations for the qualitative, rather than quantitative, part of the tests. Overseas lenders such as Deutsche Bank, Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse AG, and UBS AG are now spending heavily and recruiting project managers, data experts and other staff needed to run the complex computer models involved in the Fed's annual exercise. The outlays here are in addition to even larger sums devoted to compliance in Europe. The U.S. test assesses whether a bank could keep lending during a severe downturn and determines whether the central bank permits a firm to return capital to shareholders. At HSBC Holdings PLC, whose U.S. unit failed the Fed tests in 2014, global regulatory and compliance costs increased by $774 million last year to $2.4 billion, including investments needed to restructure the bank in the U.K. and to run U.S. and European stress tests, executives said on a Feb. 23 conference call. Stress testing around the world ""is generally becoming significantly more intense than has ever been the case in the past,"" said finance director Iain Mackay. The Fed, concerned about a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, last year began making the U.S. operations of foreign firms subject to the same regulatory regime that has already forced U.S.-based banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. to change the way they do business. Overseas banks are required by the Fed to organize their U.S. operations under a single holding company by mid-2016. By 2017, they must comply with a rule that will force them to maintain minimum capital levels here. In the past month, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Credit Suisse, and UBS have all posted jobs related to the U.S. stress tests on the social-networking site LinkedIn. Credit Suisse is forming a U.S. stress-test management group to ensure the bank's overall control environment meets the Federal Reserve's expectations, according to the postings. Barclays is hiring staff to help design and build technology to prepare for the tests. Santander has appointed a new U.S. chief executive, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. Earlier, it put in place new chief financial and risk officers, invested in technology and changed its governance policies as part of an effort to improve regulatory compliance. All the banks declined to comment on their stress-test preparations. Both Deutsche Bank and Santander have said they are working to improve compliance. ""There has definitely been what is perceived as a quantum increase [in regulation] of foreign banking organization in the U.S.,"" said V. Gerard Comizio, a partner in the global banking practice group in the Washington office of law firm Paul Hastings. The Fed declined to comment on the stress-test performance of specific banks. Officials at the central bank have justified the extra capital and stress-testing requirements for U.S. units of foreign banks by noting their activities have expanded significantly in recent decades and could affect financial stability here. During the 2008 financial crisis, foreign firms were relying heavily on overnight U.S. dollar loans when markets wobbled and froze. The U.S. central bank had to provide what it called ""extraordinary support"" in the form of dollar funding to those firms. Still, some European officials have chafed at the added U.S. oversight, saying it isn't necessary to require minimum capital levels at U.S.-based subsidiaries because European parent companies have significantly improved their capital positions. Deutsche Bank and Santander passed stress tests run by the European Central Bank in October, but those examinations didn't include the kind of qualitative criteria that are part of the Fed's effort. ""We're not for a minute suggesting there shouldn't be different stress tests in different jurisdictions,"" said Jonathan Faull, director general for financial stability at the European Commission. ""What I think makes sense is that we should discuss methodologies and to the extent possible look at results together."" Failing the test is both a public-relations hit and a financial constraint, though the impact is more pronounced for U.S. banks than foreign firms, whose U.S. units are a small part of their overall business. It usually raises questions among investors about banks' ability to manage U.S. regulations. U.S. subsidiaries of banks that fail face limitations on moving profits back to the parent companies. Deutsche Bank and Santander's challenges aren't unique. Seven foreign-owned firms are taking the stress test this year, but according to Fed projections, 10 additional foreign banks will eventually be subject to new, stricter rules requiring a single U.S. holding company with minimum capital levels. By 2018, all those firms' U.S. holding companies will be subject to the stress tests, according to the projections. For Santander, the compliance effort has meant integrating its banking subsidiary with Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc., its huge auto-lending business. Santander Consumer hadn't been regulated by the Fed, meaning it wasn't subject to requirements for risk controls, governance structures and the like. Last May, Santander Consumer declared a $52 million dividend, but then was told by the Fed that the move violated a restriction imposed on its U.S. parent company for failing the Fed's stress test. In November, Santander Consumer said it had received a Justice Department subpoena scrutinizing ""the underwriting and securitization"" of auto loans. Deutsche Bank is also in the midst of a reorganization that will include integrating its profitable securities and investment-banking business with Deutsche Bank Trust Corp., its U.S. bank holding company. The latter unit is the one that is expected to fail the stress test, according to people familiar with the matter. ""Doing a reorganization in the middle of your first or second year of stress testing is a disaster for all of these banks,"" said David Little, managing director for enterprise risk solutions at Moody's Analytics. ""These are very significant infrastructure builds [and] you can imagine too that these are pretty resource-intensive and everybody is kind of hunting for the same knowledge base.""

Doc_104,"U.S. Jobless Claims Up Slightly Last Week; Claims increased by 1,000 to 291,000 in the week ended March 14","Morath, Eric",[...]many economists are forecasting economic growth to ease to below a 2% annual pace in the first quarter.,"WASHINGTON--The number of Americans seeking first-time unemployment benefits rose slightly last week, but remains consistent with an economy that's adding jobs. Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, increased by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 291,000 in the week ended March 14, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected 292,000 new claims. ""There is little evidence that the businesses have responded to weaker growth in the U.S. economy this quarter by cutting workers,"" said Moody's Analytics economist Ryan Sweet. The Labor Department said there were no special factors affecting this week's data. The prior week's level was revised up to 290,000 claims, from an initially reported 289,000. The four-week moving average for claims, which evens out weekly volatility, rose by 2,250 to 304,750 last week. Claims, a proxy for layoffs, had trended down through most of last year and were just above a postrecession low in late January. Claims climbed in February to the highest level since May 2014 , before steadying in recent weeks. Other measures show a strong labor market. Employers added a seasonally adjusted 295,000 jobs in February , the Labor Department said earlier this month. That marked the 12th straight month U.S. payrolls grew by more than 200,000 jobs, the best streak since 1995. The unemployment rate was 5.5% last month, the lowest reading since May 2008. ""The unemployment rate has come down more rapidly than I would have expected, and the labor market has improved more rapidly than I would have expected,"" Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said at a news conference Wednesday . Following a two-day policy meeting, the Fed signaled that it could move to raise interest rates from near zero as soon as June. In contrast to strong hiring, retail spending, industrial output and consumer confidence have all slowed somewhat this winter. As a result, many economists are forecasting economic growth to ease to below a 2% annual pace in the first quarter. The latest claims data is closely watched because it coincides with the survey week for the monthly jobs report. Claims were a modest 9,000 higher than the comparable week in February. ""The trend in claims remains pretty upbeat regarding conditions in the labor market,"" said J.P. Morgan Chase economist Daniel Silver. But the change from a month ago suggests ""that conditions in the labor market may have cooled somewhat."" Thursday's report showed the number of people filing continuing claims for unemployment benefits decreased by 11,000 to 2.42 million for the week ended March 7. Continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag.

Doc_105,Investors Warm to European Multifamily Housing; The Apartment-Rental Sector Has Yet to Gain Traction on Much of the Continent,"Patnaude, Art",None available.,"With capital flowing into European real estate at levels not seen since before the crash, some investors are taking a fresh look at rental apartments, a sector that has yet to gain traction on most of the Continent. In the U.S., the so-called multifamily sector is dominated by huge companies such as Equity Residential and AvalonBay Communities Inc., which own hundreds of thousands of units. But in most of Europe, rental-apartment ownership is fragmented. In the U.K. and France, private landlords typically own only a handful of apartments. In Germany and the Netherlands, corporate landlords are relatively small. That is beginning to change. In the U.K., France and Spain, institutions are accumulating multifamily properties. While the portfolios they have built are still tiny compared to those of the U.S. giants, the fledgling industry in Europe is being powered by demographic changes, strong real-estate sales, opportunities created by the financial downturn and government actions designed to encourage development. One sign of growth: foreign investment. In London, for example, a venture of Qatari Diar Real Estate Co. and Delancey is converting the former Olympic village into a massive apartment rental project that could eventually have more than 3,000 units. In Spain, Blackstone Group LP has purchased 4,000 units. The firm may decide to expand the portfolio further; it is still studying the sector, according to people familiar with the plans. Legal changes also are paving the way. In France, a law passed in 2013 introduced tax breaks that are meant to encourage developers and investors to pair up to build new, purpose-built multifamily buildings, said Vincent Mahê©, general counsel at Groupe SNI. The company, which manages about 100,000 homes rented out at market prices and 200,000 government-subsidized homes, closed a [euro]515 million ($615 million) fund in June to build 5,000 new multifamily units. It expects to increase the fund to [euro]700 million by next summer. SNI's fund, which pulled in investments from mostly French life insurers, shows ""something is changing in the way French institutions are looking at residential,"" Mr. Mahê© said. The Intermediate Housing Fund will aim to offer investors a yield of 3.5% to 4% annually. Europe has been slow to develop a U.S.-style multifamily sector partly because the rental properties vary greatly on the Continent. European apartments tend to be older and aren't standardized like the huge apartment complexes found in suburbs throughout the U.S. What is on the market ""is, to say the least, variable in quality,"" said Adam Challis, head of residential research at property broker JLL. ""Compared with North America, even the more developed residential markets like Germany and the Netherlands are still largely biased toward historic, [government-subsidized] housing stock than the higher-quality stock you'd find, for instance, in Boston."" Even though some laws are changing, regulatory factors in Europe still can tend to discourage the growth of a multifamily industry. For instance, in countries including Austria, Denmark, Germany and Sweden, it is hard to evict tenants. ""People need places to live, and you'll find governments can regulate that right heavily,"" said Marcus Cieleback, head of research at German property firm Patrizia, for which multifamily units make up half of its [euro]14 billion under management. Still, Germany's multifamily sector is the most mature. Its apartment rental market, the biggest in Europe, got its start after World War II, when local governments built hundreds of thousands of units for residents of cities whose urban centers had been ravaged. In the early part of this century, local governments, short on cash, sold portfolios of formerly public housing to international investors. In 2014, institutional investors made some big bets in the German multifamily market. Real-estate firm Deutsche Annington Immobilien SE in December agreed to buy rival Gagfah SA for [euro]3.88 billion. The deal, pending a broadly expected shareholder approval, would create the largest landlord in the country, with 350,000 homes. Pension funds and other institutions also are becoming more comfortable owning multifamily property outside their home countries. Analysts say part of this is because of fundamentals: Populations are shifting into urban centers, and people in some countries are increasingly renting instead of owning. Also, multifamily property has a history of stable, long-term income returns. Investors bought about $23.5 billion of rental apartments in Europe in 2014 as of Dec. 18, compared with $75 billion in the U.S, according to Real Capital Analytics. In 2013, Europe had $30 billion invested, the data show; the average was $17.2 billion annually since 2007. Meanwhile, the political winds are changing when it comes to the multifamily sector. For example, the government in the Netherlands is concerned that housing associations created in the 19th century to provide subsidized accommodation to the poor--but which now own about 33% of all Dutch homes--have too much control over the market. The groups are being encouraged to sell off large portfolios to international investors. In the U.K., local governments concerned about an acute housing shortage are assisting developers more than in the past. Gatehouse Bank PLC, which is building 927 new private rental homes in the north of England, was able to buy land for the development from local governments at a discounted price. The Greater London Authority placed certain restrictions on the sale of land, allowing Realstar Living, a U.K. subsidiary of Canadian residential investor Realstar Group, to buy it for a price that supported a multifamily development. ""You've got strong long-term trends supporting the sector, which we think is going to professionalize further,"" said Jos Short, executive chairman at U.K. firm Internos Global Investors, which manages $5.6 billion of real estate and is exploring opportunities in the U.K. and the Netherlands. ""And you have some interesting return characteristics. You put all that together andyou've got quite a nice strategy.""

The company swung to a loss on higher expenses, including charges related to the pending acquisition of Trulia Inc. Zillow said it plans to close the deal as soon as Feb. 17 , following notification from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it had granted antitrust approval. The all-stock deal was valued at about $3.5 billion when it was announced in July. At Friday's closing price of $106.50, the value would be about $2.34 billion.

Doc_107,Tailored Accounting at IPOs Raises Flags; Critics Say Companies' Increased Use of Customized Earnings Measures Could Confuse Investors,"Rapoport, Michael","According to Audit Analytics data, 59% of the companies that filed for an IPO since 2012 have used nonstandard metrics, compared with 48% in 2010 and 2011.","Zoe's Kitchen Inc. is serving up profits--but only after leaving some of its expenses off the menu. Zoe's, a chain of 125-plus Mediterranean-theme restaurants that went public in April, reported an adjusted profit of $13.2 million for the first nine months of 2014 under its own accounting treatments that strip out a variety of expenses. Including those expenses, as is required under standard accounting rules, Zoe's reported a loss of $8.4 million. It is far from an isolated example. Forty companies went public in 2014 reporting losses under traditional accounting rules but showing profits under their own tailor-made measures. That is 18% of all U.S. initial public offerings for the year, according to consulting firm Audit Analytics, the highest level since at least 2009. Of 2014's 10 biggest IPOs, nine used nonstandard earnings measures alongside the official accounting treatment to some degree. Many companies prefer highlighting their own customized measures, saying they give investors a better picture of the company. That worries some experts, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has written letters to Zoe's and other companies telling them the bespoke figures they use are given too much prominence in regulatory filings and asking for revisions. Nonstandard metrics give investors ""the best measure"" of continuing performance, said Jason Morgan, chief financial officer of Zoe's, who added that the SEC's concerns were addressed in the company's case by revising its prospectus. But as the IPO market heated up last year, observers have raised fears that companies' increased use of these nonstandard measures could confuse or mislead investors at a time when they are forming their first impression of a company. ""I think it's a sign of frothiness"" in the IPO market, said Brandon Rees, deputy director of the AFL-CIO's Office of Investment. ""Why investors tolerate it, I don't know."" Some say the costs that companies strip out of their nonstandard measures are increasingly things that should be counted in earnings calculations, such as executive bonuses, fees for stock offerings and acquisition expenses. ""I was just astounded at the wide variety of elements that people thought were appropriate to exclude,"" said Curtis Verschoor, a DePaul University emeritus professor of accountancy. Investors should be aware that a company's nonstandard numbers ""are more likely to be slanted rather than balanced,"" he said. Companies must still prominently disclose their earnings under generally accepted accounting principles, the standard set of U.S. accounting rules, even if they also spotlight their earnings under ""non-GAAP"" measures. ""It's knee-jerk to say that's a place where companies put bad stuff,"" said Mike Guthrie, chief financial officer of TrueCar Inc., an auto-buying-and-selling platform that went public in May. For the first nine months of 2014, TrueCar had a $38.6 million loss under standard rules but a $6.6 million profit under ""adjusted Ebitda""--earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, modified further to exclude other costs, such as an $803,000 expense to acquire rights to the company's stock symbol. Mr. Guthrie said it would be more misleading for the companies not to present adjusted measures; the stock-symbol cost, for instance, was a one-time expense that won't affect TrueCar's future results. TrueCar closed Wednesday at $20.94 a share, up 133% from its IPO price of $9. According to Audit Analytics data, 59% of the companies that filed for an IPO since 2012 have used nonstandard metrics, compared with 48% in 2010 and 2011. Many go beyond the items that companies most frequently strip out of their preferred measures, such as employee stock compensation and foreign-exchange gains and losses. A PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP survey found 80% of IPO companies that made adjustments to their Ebitda from 2010 to 2013 had at least one adjustment beyond the more-common strip-outs, though PwC said it couldn't comment on individual companies. The growth in such reporting by IPO companies comes in part because more technology and service-based companies are coming public. Those companies are more likely to use accounting estimates and subjective measures when compared with traditional bricks-and-mortar companies, said Jay Ritter, a University of Florida finance professor who tracks IPOs. The SEC has expressed concern in the past about companies' non-GAAP metrics, notably with regard to daily-deals company Groupon Inc. Before Groupon's 2011 IPO, the SEC raised questions about its use of ""adjusted consolidated segment operating income,"" a metric that excluded Groupon's marketing costs to land new subscribers. Groupon scaled back its use of the metric in response to the SEC concerns. Groupon couldn't be reached for comment. In the past two years, the commission has sent comment letters to more than 30 companies, both pre-IPO companies and those already public, criticizing them for giving nonstandard earnings measures ""undue prominence"" in their securities filings. Zoe's received such a letter in January 2014. Zoe's had mentioned its adjusted Ebitda first in the ""management's discussion and analysis"" section of its prospectus, four pages before providing an earnings table that followed standard accounting rules. The SEC also questioned Zoe's exclusion of some cash expenses from its adjusted Ebitda, such as the costs of opening new restaurants and management and consulting fees. Zoe's prospectus had been filed under seal with the SEC at the time, and the company revised its filings to address the ""undue prominence"" criticism before it filed a public prospectus in March, the company's finance chief, Mr. Morgan, said. Whether the expenses should be excluded ""came down to an interpretation"" of regulations, and the company didn't change its methodology, he added.
